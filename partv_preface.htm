			<p>Part V of the <i>Thomas
				A. Edison Papers: A Selective Microfilm Edition</i> begins with the year 1911,
				when the sixty-four-year-old inventor consolidated his National Phonograph Co.
				with several other Edison companies to form Thomas A. Edison, Inc. It concludes
				with the year 1919 when the Treaty of Versailles finally put an end to the long
				years of war and enabled Edison and other Americans to turn again to peacetime
				pursuits.</p>
			
			<p>The period documented in
				Part V was a time of intense activity for Edison, his laboratory, and his
				companies. Several important new inventions were created and marketed between
				1911 and 1919. These included the Blue Amberol record (a significantly improved
				cylinder record), Diamond Disc phonographs and records, an office dictating machine
				that became known as the Ediphone, a home movie projector called the home
				kinetoscope, and a safety lamp for miners that won Edison the prestigious
				Rathenau Medal. At a time before the gasoline engine had gained universal
				acceptance, Edison worked hard to apply his alkaline storage battery to the
				propulsion of automobiles and commercial delivery trucks. Along with his chief
				engineer Miller Reese Hutchison, he sought other commercial and military
				applications for his battery, including ships, submarines, communications
				systems, and the homes for rural dwellers who lived beyond the gas and electric
				mains. And more than a decade before the release of <i>The Jazz Singer</i>,
				Edison himself introduced talking pictures to theater goers in the Americas,
				Europe, and Asia with his kinetophone.</p>
			
			<p>During this period
				Edison forged a longstanding personal and business relationship with automobile
				manufacturer Henry Ford, who joined him in a series of highly publicized
				camping trips that included industrialist Harvey Firestone and naturalist John
				Burroughs. In 1911 he embarked on a two-month tour of Great Britain and
				Continental Europe with his wife Mina and their three children, during which
				the inventor commented extensively on the culture, society, and government of
				the nations that would soon be convulsed by war. Four years later, he took a
				cross-country train trip and spent two weeks on the West Coast, visiting the
				Panama&#8209;Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco and the Panama&#8209;California
				Exposition in San Diego. During his interviews with the press on these and
				other occasions, Edison voiced his opinions about a wide variety of topics,
				including war and preparedness, Henry Ford's controversial peace plan, the
				presidential elections of 1912 and 1916, women's suffrage, temperance and
				prohibition, cigarette smoking, health and diet, musical tastes, popular
				culture, and religion.</p>
			
			<p>The years 1911-1919
				witnessed important changes in Edison's companies and in his laboratory. The
				number of employees at the West Orange complex increased from about 2,300 at
				the beginning of 1911 to approximately 10,000 by the end of the war. A severe
				labor shortage occasioned by the entrance of the United States into the war
				brought a substantial number of female workers into Edison's factories. By 1919
				women comprised 20 percent of the workforce. There were also significant
				changes in the management of Edison's companies. In November 1912 Frank L.
				Dyer, who had been general counsel and head of the Legal Department since 1904,
				resigned as president of Thomas A. Edison, Inc., and Edison himself took over
				the leadership of his company. In 1915 efficiency engineer Stephen B. Mambert
				initiated an important change in the organization of Edison Industries with his
				divisional policy. The reorganization theoretically gave considerable autonomy
				to the managers of each manufacturing and selling division. In reality, it
				consolidated Mambert's power as financial executive and enabled him to build
				his own empire within the larger organization.</p>
			
			<p>The changes in the
				laboratory had begun in 1910 with the establishment of the Engineering
				Department and the creation of the new position of chief engineer. Donald
				Bliss, the first man to hold the position, proved ineffective, and Edison
				replaced him with Miller Reese Hutchison in August 1912. Hutchison's influence
				extended beyond the laboratory, as the inventor also made him exclusive agent
				for the sale of Edison storage batteries to the U.S. Navy and other departments
				of the United States government. Hutchison's freewheeling business practices
				generated animosity among the officials of the Edison Storage Battery Co.,
				aroused the enmity of Mambert, and ultimately led to his resignation as chief
				engineer in July 1918. He was succeeded by John P. Constable, a friend and
				classmate of Charles Edison.</p>
			
			<p>The Engineering
				Department had been created to separate the experimental activities of the
				laboratory from more routine product engineering. Product engineers like
				Constable and Newman Henry Holland were responsible for making refinements in
				existing inventions and developing more cost-efficient methods for
				manufacturing them. The new department reflected a shift in the focus of the
				West Orange laboratory from the creation of new technologies to product
				improvement and production efficiency. Longtime experimenters like Charles
				Dally and Fred Ott, who had received their education in the factory machine
				shop, were now outnumbered by college-educated engineers and chemists.</p>
			
			<p>Edison's own inventive
				activities during the early 1910s were focused primarily on the perfection of a
				disc phonograph to compete with the machines manufactured by Victor and other
				rival companies. His key innovation was the development of a diamond needle and
				floating-weight recorder assembly that allowed for very high quality recordings
				and playback. His associate Jonas Walter Aylsworth developed a heat-resistant
				composition called Condensite that proved to be the major technical
				breakthrough in the development of the Diamond Disc record, while Walter Miller
				and others devised methods for making master disc molds and manufacturing the
				records. In September 1912 Edison assembled a crew of experimenters, who worked
				night and day for five weeks to overcome the final challenge in the mass
				production of disc records&#151;the development of a reliable method for coating
				the disc record blanks with Condensite. Their success earned them the title of
				Insomnia Squad. Although Edison himself used that appellation exclusively in
				connection with the experimental team he put together in 1912, the phrase
				&quot;Insomnia Squad&quot; has since become part of our popular culture and is
				often used today to characterize Edison's entire laboratory staff going back to
				the nineteenth century. </p>
			
			<p>Long after the labors of
				the Insomnia Squad had ended and disc records had been put on the market, the
				Edison Diamond Disc remained a work in progress. Customers complained about
				surface noise and a tendency of the Condensite veneer to detach from the core
				material. Edison set his research team to work on these and other problems, and
				many of the items in the Notebook Series relate to experiments on disc records.
				Other notebooks pertain to efforts to improve recording techniques in order to
				produce records of the highest acoustic quality. Despite his severe hearing
				deficiency, Edison took a personal interest in the artists and music to be
				recorded for his discs and cylinders, and he was primarily responsible for his
				company's record catalog. </p>
			
			<p>The outbreak of war in
				Europe in August 1914 pushed Edison's inventive and business activities in a
				new direction. He became a major spokesman for preparedness, and his ideas
				spurred the creation of the Naval Consulting Board, on which he served as
				president. To overcome the shortages of chemicals previously obtained from
				Germany, he quickly built new manufacturing plants and became a major chemical
				supplier not only to American industries but to the European allies and Japan
				as well. </p>
			
			<p>In 1917, a few months
				before the United States formally entered the war, Edison and his assistants
				began conducting antisubmarine experiments for the U.S. Navy, as well as other
				military research, at a specially equipped new laboratory at the top of Eagle
				Rock Mountain in West Orange. The sinking of the RMS <i>Lusitania </i>two years
				earlier had dramatically underscored the ease with which German U-boats could
				destroy merchant ships and inflict great loss of life. Much of the inventor's
				military research, which is documented in seventeen notebooks, was focused on
				methods of locating U-boats and camouflaging merchant ships. During the summer
				and early fall of 1917, he spent six weeks on Long Island Sound conducting
				experiments aboard the USS <i>Sachem</i>, a large private steam yacht that had
				been commissioned by the Navy for military service. He subsequently continued
				his research in an office at the Navy Annex in Washington once occupied by
				Admiral George Dewey and at the U.S. Naval Station in Key West. Edison's
				relationship with the Navy bureaucracy was sometimes contentious, and he found
				himself engaged in an acrimonious debate with other members of the Naval
				Consulting Board over the location and purpose of the proposed naval research
				laboratory.</p>
			
			<p>The war also had a
				profound effect on Edison's family. His eldest daughter Marion had been living
				in Germany since the 1890s with her husband Oscar Oeser, an officer of the
				Imperial German Army. With the onset of war, she found herself trapped behind
				enemy lines and eventually fled to Switzerland. Her marriage to Oscar, already
				strained by the war, deteriorated even further in 1919 after she discovered
				that he was having an affair with a waitress from a local bierhaus. They
				divorced two years later. While Marion's husband was fighting on the German
				side, her brother William joined the U.S. Army at the age of thirty-nine and
				served in France as a sergeant in the recently established Tank Corps. Thomas
				A. Edison, Jr., who called the war &quot;a greater tragedy than will ever be
				known,&quot; was the only child from Edison's first marriage to be &quot;spared
				from its weapons.&quot; Still trying to emulate his father's success as an
				inventor, he developed a fuel-saving device for automobiles called the
				&quot;ecometer&quot; and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Henry Ford to adopt
				his invention. In 1919 he moved back to West Orange and was soon working again
				for his father in the laboratory.</p>
			
			<p>The war also affected
				the lives of Edison's sons from his second marriage, Charles and Theodore,
				although neither joined the military. In June 1916, Charles took over the
				management of the Edison companies, as his father found himself increasingly
				preoccupied with his chemical plants and his work on the Naval Consulting
				Board. Together with Mark M. Jones, the director of personnel, he initiated a
				series of innovations that put Edison Industries on the cutting edge of the
				modern management movement. Eighteen-year-old Theodore was eager to join the
				army when the United States entered the war. Mina Edison, perhaps remembering
				the fate of her brother Theodore who was killed in the Spanish-American War,
				dissuaded her son from enlisting, and he spent the war on his father's research
				staff conducting military experiments in West Orange and on an island in the
				Florida Keys. Six weeks before the outbreak of war in Europe, Madeleine Edison,
				the oldest child of Thomas and Mina, married John Eyre Sloane of South Orange.
				An inventor and businessman like his father-in-law, Sloane spent part of the
				war in Washington, D.C. as an officer in the U.S. Signal Corps. Madeleine was
				the only Edison child to have children of her own. On March 4, 1916 she gave
				birth to Thomas Edison (&quot;Teddy&quot;) Sloane&#151;the first of Thomas
				Edison's four grandsons. The inventor, still conducting experiments for the
				U.S. Navy at Key West, was not present to celebrate the birth of his second
				grandchild, John Edison (&quot;Jack&quot;) Sloane, on April 21, 1918. </p>
			
			<p>The approximately
				100,000 pages of technical notes, business and family correspondence, patent
				records, newspaper and journal clippings, and other documents in Part V are
				arranged in series that parallel the record groups in the archives of the
				Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey. As in previous parts,
				the guide to Part V contains series notes, a chronology, an annotated list of
				Edison and related companies, and an essay on editorial procedures. In
				addition, there are essays on Edison's family, his management team, and his
				laboratory and wartime research staff, along with biographical sketches of more
				than 350 family members, managers, and employees. </p>
