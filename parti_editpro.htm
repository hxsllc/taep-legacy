                            <p><font size=+2>A</font>ll of the documents appearing in Part I (1850-1878) are  from the archives at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park (ENHP) in West Orange, New    Jersey. Important documents for this time period also  exist in other repositories and private collections in the United States  and elsewhere. A selection of this material is available in the <u><a href="/snorep.htm">Outside  Repositories</a></u> edition   on the Edison Papers website.</p>
                            <p><font size=+2>N</font>ot all of the documents appearing in Part I fit neatly  within its chronological limits. For example, there are several laboratory  notebooks from the mid-1870s that continue through 1879 or 1880. Similarly,  many of the Menlo Park  scrapbooks from the 1870s contain clippings from the 1880s as well. The  testimony and exhibits in the seven volumes of telephone interferences  (Litigation Series) were submitted to the Patent Office in 1880. However, these  volumes are included in Part I because most of the testimony relates to Edison's activities prior to 1879 and because the  exhibits are primarily facsimiles of technical and notes and drawings generated  during the 1870s.</p>
                            <p><h2><a name="sel"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Selection of Documents</strong></h2></p>
                            <p><strong><font size=+2>G</font>eneral Principles</strong>. The edition as a whole will  encompass approximately 10 percent of the total number of extant Edison&#8209;related  documents. In general, the edition includes: (1) documents that Edison  generated or had prepared under his direction; (2) documents written by or sent  to Edison's principal laboratory and business associates; (3) correspondence  and other incoming documents containing substantial annotations by Edison; (4)  other important documents that Edison probably saw or was influenced by; and  (5) documents that contain significant information about Edison, his laboratory  and business associates, and their activities. Documents not selected include:  (1) routine financial documents such as bills, receipts, invoices, vouchers,  checks, and orders; (2) most of the day&#8209;to&#8209;day business records of the Edison  companies; and (3) unsolicited correspondence relating to matters outside the  mainstream of Edison's inventive, business,  and personal activities. In addition, dockets and endorsements entered onto the  back of correspondence, reports, and other unbound documents are not selected  unless they contain significant information not found in the document itself.</p>
                          
                              <p><font size=+2>M</font>ore specific selection information can be found in the  series and subseries targets and on the targets immediately preceding each  folder and bound volume in the digital edition.</p>
                              <p><strong><font size=+2>S</font>election Principles for Part I. </strong>Part I contains approximately 90 percent of the  documents in the ENHP archives for the period 1850&#8209;1878. Because the  documentation for the years prior to 1878 is relatively sparse, nearly all of  it is selected. The selection of documents from 1878 is more stringent. The  long runs of routine bills, receipts, and bills of lading are not selected, and  the large volume of unsolicited correspondence from 1878 is sampled rather than  published in its totality. On the other hand, all of Edison's  business correspondence and all of the laboratory materials, including several  hundred undated notes and drawings from the 1870s, are selected.</p>
                              <p><font size=+2>T</font>he documents included in the digital edition are presented  in their entirety with the following exceptions: (1) facing pairs of blank  pages in the notebooks, scrapbooks, and account books; ( 2) duplicate pages and  totally illegible pages in the letterbooks; (3) overlapping sets of clippings  and multi-page pamphlets, circulars, and journal articles pasted into the  scrapbooks (unless they relate directly to the inventive or business activities  of Edison); and (4) briefs, arguments, and other material presented by opposing  attorneys in the telephone interference cases (unless they comment at length  upon the work of Edison).</p>
                              <h2><a name="org"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Organization and  Arrangement of the Collections</strong></h2>
                              <p><strong><font size=+2>G</font>eneral Principles</strong>. The digital edition is intended  to provide researchers with the most important documents in the ENHP archives  and with an entr&eacute;e to those documents not selected. Accordingly, the documents  are arranged in series that parallel existing record groups in the ENHP  archives&nbsp; The documents in many of the  larger series, such as the Notebook Series, are further arranged within  subseries. The Series Notes provide detailed descriptions of the contents of  each series and subseries.</p>
                              <p><font size=+2>B</font>ecause of the size and complexity of the ENHP archives,  related documents can frequently be found in several series in the digital  edition. For example, while most of Edison's  incoming correspondence is filed in the Document File (Edison General File)  Series, other letters addressed to him appear in the Company Records Series,  Legal Series, Special Collections Series, and elsewhere. A more extensive  discussion of the relationships among the various series can be found in the  targets introducing each series in the digital edition. </p>
                              <p><strong><font size=+2>O</font>rganization of Part I.</strong> The documents appear on the  microfilm in ten series: (1) U.S. Patents, (2) Notebook Series, (3) Patent  Series, (4) Litigation Series, (5) Document File Series, (6) Account Series,  (7) Menlo Park Scrapbook Series, (8) Miscellaneous Scrapbook Series, (9)  Letterbook Series, and (10) Legal Series. The microfilmed patent volumes are  not included in the digital edition. Instead, the complete set of Edison's patents appears online at <u><a href="/patents.htm">Thomas Edison's  Patents</a></u>.</p>
                          
                              <p><font size=+2>T</font>he laboratory notebooks are grouped into five subseries  according to their provenance: (1) Newark Shop Notebooks, (2) Experimental  Researches, (3) Unbound Notebooks, (4) Pocket Notebooks, and (5) Miscellaneous  Notebooks. In the case of numbered sets such as the Experimental Notebooks  (volumes 1&#8209;6) and the Unbound Notebooks (volumes 8&#8209;18), the individual books  are organized by volume number. In the case of unnumbered sets like the Pocket  Notebooks and the Miscellaneous Notebooks, the books are arranged in  chronological order according to the earliest date in each book.</p>
                              <p><font size=+2>T</font>he volumes in the Account Series are organized according to  the company of origin and sub&#8209;organized into summary accounts, books of  original entry, and cost accounts. The Litigation Records are organized by  case. Other series of bound volumes are organized by volume number (Menlo Park  Scrapbooks) or in chronological order (Miscellaneous Scrapbooks, Letterbooks).</p>
                              <p><font size=+2>T</font>he incoming correspondence and other unbound items in the  Document File Series are organized by year and by subjects within each year.  Within each subject folder, the documents appear in chronological order with  undated documents at the end. Enclosures and attachments, however, appear  immediately after their cover letter.</p>
                              <h2><a name="tar"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Descriptive Targets</strong></h2>
                              <p><font size=+2>T</font>argets are editorial aids that appear on the microfilm to  assist readers in using the materials in the collection. Targets introduce each  series, each major subseries, and most of the individual volumes and folders.  The series and subseries targets are essentially more detailed versions of the  Series Notes in the guide. The target preceding each folder or volume provides  information about authorship, inclusive dates, and number of pages (for bound  volumes). Also included is a description of the character and contents of the  folder or volume and, wherever appropriate, cross&#8209;references to related  materials. In addition, each target provides a brief characterization of any  material in the folder or volume that is not selected The targets preceding the  notebooks, account books, and most other bound volumes also contain an  enumeration of missing page numbers and of blank pages not filmed.</p>
                              <p><font size=+2>O</font>ccasionally, targets also accompany individual documents in  order to: (1) explain relationships among documents (for example, the targets  &quot;ENCLOSURE&quot; and &quot;ATTACHMENT&quot;), (2) describe multiple  versions of a document (for example, the targets &quot;TRANSLATION FOLLOWS&quot;  and &quot;TRANSLATION&quot;), (3) supply missing information (for example, the  date or author of a letter), and (4) indicate missing information (the target  &quot;INCOMPLETE&quot;).</p>
                              <p><font size=+2>T</font>he editors have tried to keep the targets as concise as  possible and to avoid including speculative and subjective judgments about the  contents of laboratory notebooks and other complicated technical documents.  References to specific technologies in the targets have necessarily resulted in  a certain amount of oversimplification because many of the technologies are  interrelated. The specific technologies mentioned in each target should not,  therefore, be regarded as all&#8209;inclusive.</p>
                          
                            <p><font size=+2>B</font>ecause of the large number of items in the edition and the  difficulty of anticipating the legibility of a document on the microfilm,  targets are not generally used to identify individual documents that are faint,  discolored, water&#8209;damaged, or otherwise difficult to read in the original. In  cases where a particular folder or volume contains a large number of such  documents, the problem is noted in the target introducing that folder or  volume. In the case of Edison's letterbooks,  all of which contain a substantial number of marginally legible documents, the  problem is also discussed in the target introducing the series.</p>
                            <h2><a name="ide"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Identification Numbers and  Other Archival Inscriptions</strong></h2>
                            <p><font size=+2>O</font>ver the years the archivists and curators responsible for  the Edison collections have used a variety of  identification systems for the documents. One of the earliest was the N&#8209;number,  which was assigned to most of the standard&#8209;size laboratory notebooks generated  between 1878 and 1934. This six&#8209;digit number, prefixed by the letter  &quot;N,&quot; corresponds to the first dated entry in the notebook. For  example, a notebook whose first dated entry is for November 9, 1878 is  classified as N&#8209;78&#8209;11&#8209;09. A similar number, with the prefix &quot;PN,&quot;  identifies each pocket notebook. Readers should be aware, however, that this  number is not always a reliable indicator of the date when a book was first put  to use. Many books were in use for a long period of time before any entry was  dated. Moreover, hundreds of books contain no date, and subsequent research has  indicated that many of the dates conjectured for such books are erroneous. For more information regarding
	N-numbers and other numbering systems used for Edison's notebooks, see
	the editorial note, &quot;<a href="/NamesSearch/glocpage.php?gloc=NA0000">Numbering Systems for Edison's Notebooks</a>.&quot;</p>
                            <p><font size=+2>U</font>ntil 1971 the documents processed into the archives were  often assigned a sequential accession number prefixed by the letter  &quot;E.&quot; These E&#8209;numbers appear most often on notebooks, scrapbooks, and  other bound items, but they were also used occasionally for collections of  unbound documents and even individual items. After the National Park Service  assumed ownership of the archives in 1957, many of the documents were re&#8209;cataloged  and assigned NPS catalog numbers. Since that system is still in use at the  ENHP, all documents with NPS catalog numbers are identified in the microfilm  edition by that number. E&#8209;numbers are indicated only in cases of documents  lacking any other identifying number.</p>
                            <p><font size=+2>M</font>oreover, the early archivists and curators of the Edison collections possessed no formal training in the  principles of archival management. Some of them did not consider it  inappropriate to record on the manuscripts their own observations about the  people, events, and issues discussed in the documents. Such comments sometimes  appear in the margins of the documents and, at other times, within the text  itself. Occasionally they are contained within brackets or parentheses, but  more often they appear without any distinguishing punctuation. Many of the  longer and more discursive remarks are followed by the initials  &quot;N.R.S.&quot; (Norman R. Speiden). In most cases, a reader who is aware of  this problem can easily distinguish between these comments and the actual text  of the document. </p>
