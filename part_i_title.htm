          <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
          <p>One of the principal underpinnings of any major
            editing and publication project is the financial support that makes it
            possible. From an early point in the project's history a number of key
            people and organizations played critical roles in providing a financial
            foundation. President Edward Bloustein of Rutgers University strongly supported
            the project both within and outside the University. William C. Hittinger,
            vice president for research at RCA Corporation, became the chairman of
            the Edison Corporate Associates and recruited a distinguished group of
            corporation executives to aid in private fund-raising for the project.
            This group included: Morris Tanenbaum, president of AT&amp;T Communications;
            the late Arthur M. Bueche, vice president for research and development
            at the General Electric Company; Cees Bruynes, president of North American
            Philips Corporation; Paul Lego, executive vice president of Westinghouse
            Electric Corporation; Robert I. Smith, chairman of Public Service Electric
            and Gas Company; Paul J. Christiansen, president of the Charles Edison
            Fund; Roland W Schmitt, senior vice president for corporate research and
            development at the General Electric Company; Philip F. Dietz, vice president
            and general manager of the Westinghouse Electric Company; and Harold W.
            Sonn, chairman of Public Service Electric and Gas Company. These people
            along with their associates such as John Venable of the Charles Edison
            Fund, Robert T:Cavanagh of North American Phil ips Corporation, Samuel
            Convissor of RCA Corporation, Edmund Tucker of the General Electric Foundation,
            and George Wise of the General Electric Company have given unstintingly
            of their time in behalf of the Edison Papers. Initially, Robert Lusardi
            and Michael Luck of the Rutgers University Foundation staff developed and
            organized the private fund-raising campaign. Foundation staff, notably
            Bruce Newman, Ron Miller, and Rose Cofone, worked closely with the Edison
            Corporate Associates in the later phase of the effort. </p>
         <p>Early private support for the project came from
            the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, and
            The Hyde and Watson Foundation. Also vitally important to the Edison Papers
            was strong financial support from the National Science Foundation and the
            National Endowment for the Humanities. Ronald Overmann, program director
            for the history and philosophy of science, provided valuable counsel regarding
            proposals to the National Science Foundation, and Katherine Fuller and
            George Farr did likewise at the National Endowment for the Humanities.
            The official endorsement of the project by the National Historical Publications
            and Records Commission was also most helpful. </p>
         <p>Many people with the National Park Service have
            assisted the Edison Papers project in a variety of capacities. Especially
            notable in support of the project were administrative and curatorial officers:
            William Binnewies, Lynn Wightman, Ray Kremer, Roy W. Weaver, Elizabeth
            Albro, Arthur Reed Abel, and Edward Pershey. Others who have aided the
            project include Leah Burt, Mary Bowling, John Spinnler, Marilyn Kyles,
            Marjorie Taliaferro, Karen Giacobbe, Shirley Rugg, Karen Sloat-Olsen, Frank
            McGrane, Robert Zimmerman, Clarence Askew, and Al Strand. </p>
         <p>From the beginning, the editorial and administrative
            center for the Edison Papers has been at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.
            The strong support and responsiveness of many Rutgers people truly have
            made the campus a home for the project. Among these were Paul G. Pearson
            and T. Alexander Pond, both of whom have held the office of executive vice
            president; James Kirby Martin and Nathaniel J. Pallone, academic vice presidents;
            Kenneth Wheeler, provost; and John Salapatas, associate provost. Jean Parrish,
            associate provost, has taken a special responsibility and interest in this
            project and has given its staff timely encouragement and support. </p>
         <p>A project of the scope of the Edison Papers can
            function in a major university setting only with the enthusiastic interest
            of many people. Notable administrative assistance has come from David A.
            Cayer, Albert Hanna, David A. Rumbo, Donna Estler, Mary Elizabeth Mitchell,
            Evelyn H. Wilson, Robert F. Pack, Jose A. Steinboch, Ruth L. Scott, Barbara
            Dawson, Ronnie F. Liebowitz, David R. Scott, Joseph Harrigan, and Gail
            B. Heseltine. Many colleagues in the Department of History have made special
            efforts on behalf of the Edison Papers. The project is especially indebted
            to Tilden G. Edelstein, Gerald N. Grob, John R. Gillis, James W. Reed,
            Susan R. Schrepfer, Jonathan Lurie, and Herbert H. Rowen. Unusually strong
            interest and initiative in support of the Edison Papers have come from
            associates in the Rutgers University Libraries, especially Hendrik Edelman,
            Ruth J. Simmons, Francis A. Johns, Donald A. Sinclair, Ronald L. Becker,
            Clark L. Beck, Jr., and Maxine Lurie. </p>
         <p>During the preparation of Part I of the microfilm
            edition a number of interns and students from Rutgers and from across the
            United States and Canada have provided assistance. Those not named on the
            title page include Thomas Cornell, Sara Jane Schechner, John Rumm, Michela
            Mago, Richard Myers, Jane Morley, David Rhees, Andrew Butrica, Anne Jordan,
            Mark Jones, Joel Demnitz, Joyce Bedi, Matthew McCright, Alain Canuel, and
            Dana Norvila. In its search for Edison documents, the project also benefitted
            from the counsel and assistance of Harry Goldsmith, a retired patent attorney
            and former examiner for the U.S. Patent Office. </p>
         <p>The Edison Papers project has also depended upon
            people throughout the country for advice, information, and many special
            favors. Among those who have performed numerous services for the project
            are Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., Edwin T. Layton, Jr., Robert Friedel, Howard
            Green, Israel Rubin, Jeffrey Sturchio, Neil Wasserman, Daniel Kevles, Don
            C. Skemer, Charles F. Cummings, Joel Buchwald, William C. Wright, Joan
            Richardson, Theodore Edison, and John Edison Sloane. </p>
         <p>During the summer of 1984 University Publications
            of America undertook the filming of Part I of the microfilm edition at
            the ENHS. UPA President John Moscato and his associates, including Robert
            Lester, Risa Jewell, and Cynthia Hancock, conducted this critical phase
            of publication in an unusually thorough and conscientious manner. </p>
         <p>This brief account of the history of the Edison
            Papers and of the project's indebtedness to many people and organizations
            closes with a very special expression of appreciation to a small group
            of people whose contributions, dedication, and good humor have truly made
            this project possible. This group includes the project's administrative
            assistant, Helen Endick; its first secretary, Kathryn Lipscomb Woods; its
            secretary of five years, Ann Nigro; and its secretary who recently joined
            the project, Grace Kurkowski.<br />
