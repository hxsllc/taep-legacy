         <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
          <p>A project of the scale  and complexity of the Thomas A. Edison Papers can only be successful through  the encouragement, cooperative endeavor, and support of many individuals and  organizations. Over the years, we have had the strong backing of the project's  Sponsors: Rutgers, The State University of New  Jersey; the National Park Service; the New Jersey Historical Commission; and  the Smithsonian Institution. We wish to acknowledge the continuing support of  the current representatives of the sponsoring institutions: from Rutgers  University, President Richard L. McCormick; Ziva Galili, Acting Executive Dean  of the School of Arts and Sciences; Ann Fabian, Dean of Humanities of the  School of Arts and Sciences; and Paul Clemens, Chair of the History Department;  from the Northeast Region of the National Park Service, Regional Director  Dennis Reidenbach; from the Thomas Edison National Historical Park, Superintendent Greg  A. Marshall, Assistant Superintendent Theresa Jung, and Supervisory Museum  Curator Michelle Ortwein; from the New Jersey Historical Commission, Peter  Mickulas, Senior Research Associate; from the Smithsonian Institution, Harold  Wallace, Curator of Electricity. In addition, we are indebted to numerous  former members of the Board of Sponsors, including Roger Durham, Bernard Finn,  Maryanne Gerbauckas, Howard Green, Marc Mappen, Arthur Molella, Barry Qualls,  Marie Rust, Holly M. Smith, Randy Turner, and Deborah White.</p>
         <p>The preparation of this  edition was made possible through financial support from the National Park  Service and Rutgers, The State University, as  well as public and private foundations, corporations, and individuals.  Especially notable were grants from the National Historical Publications and  Records Commission, New Jersey Historical Commission, Charles Edison Fund,  National Endowment for the Humanities, and National Trust for the Humanities.  We are grateful for the support of their executive officers, program officers,  and trustees, including Elizabeth Arndt, Roger Bruns, Bruce Cole, Timothy  Connolly, Max Evans, Michael Hall, Alice Hudgins, John P. Keegan, Mark Mappen,  Mary Murrin, Francis X. O'Brien, Ann Orr, Malcolm Richardson, and Kathy Toavs.  The opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the microfilm edition and  guide are solely those of the editors and do not necessarily reflect the views  of any of the above federal foundations or agencies, the United States  Government, or any other financial contributor. </p>
         <p>All of the documents  published in Part V are from the archives of the Thomas Edison National Historical Park  in West Orange, New Jersey. In addition to the sponsor's  representatives mentioned above, other members of the Edison  site have contributed to this edition. We are especially thankful for the  cooperation and support of archivists Leonard DeGraaf and Edward Wirth, former  archivist Douglas Tarr, collections manager Joan Harris, and the late Marilyn  Kyles, who photocopied most of the newspaper clippings that appear in Part V.  Other present and former staff who have given support and assistance include  Clarence Askew, Joseph DeMonte, Gerald Fabris, Charles Magale, Beth Miller,  Claudia Mosquera, Gregory Schmidl, and Karen Sloat-Olsen .</p>
    
         <p>Many associates at Rutgers University have contributed to the  Edison Papers. In addition to the sponsor's representatives mentioned above, we  wish to acknowledge the contributions of Philip Furmanski, Executive Vice  President for Academic Affairs, and the following members of the School of Arts  and Sciences: Barbara Lemanski, Associate Dean for Policy and Personnel; Paul  Kuznekoff, Director of Development; John Amodeo, Associate Director of  Information Technology; Thomas Vosseler, Associate Director (IT), and David  Motovidlak, Assistant Director (IT). We value the support of colleagues and  staff in the History Department, including Michael Adas, Rudolph Bell, Alastair  Bellany, John Chambers, James Masschaele, Matt Matsuda, the late Philip Pauley,  James Reed, Susan Schrepfer, Virginia Yans, Robin&nbsp; Chapdelaine, Mary DeMeo, Dawn Ruskai, and  Candace Walcott&#8209;Shepherd. Our special thanks go out to Ann Gordon, editor of  our sister project The Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.  We also wish to thank Michael Geselowitz and the staff of the IEEE History   Center, as well as  University Librarian Marianne Gaunt and the staff of the Rutgers University  Libraries, including Ronald Becker, Thomas Frusciano, Thomas Glynn, Rhonda  Marker, and James Niessen. At the Rutgers University Foundation, we have  benefitted from the assistance of President Carol P. Herring, Linda Corcoran,  John Pearson, and Jacqueline Perkel&#8209;Joseph. We are especially grateful to  Daphne Evans, Deborah Fisher-Burch, and Donna Foster, our grant specialists at  the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, headed by Michael Pazzani, Vice  President for Research, and his predecessor Michael Breton.&nbsp; We also acknowledge the contributions of  Larry Galbreath, Stephen A. Miller, and Ronald S. Thompson of the Division of  Grant and Contract Accounting, Stephen Di Paolo and Joseph Harrigan of the Controller's  Office, and Allison Thomas of University Relations. We are also grateful to the  staff of Material Services, including Peter Shergalis, James F. O'Brien, and  Susan L. O'Brien, for their assistance in consolidating the offices of the book  and microfilm editions at Rutgers in 2004 and  for numerous other services to the project.</p>
         <p>The Edison Papers is  fortunate to have University Publications of America, an imprint of LexisNexis  Academic &amp; Library Solutions, as publisher of the microfilm edition. The  documents in Part V were filmed during April-July 2007 at the LexisNexis&nbsp; micropublishing facility in St. Mary's  County, Maryland.  We are grateful for the support and assistance of the management team at St.  Mary's: James Rumple, Vice President, Imaging &amp; Manufacturing; Lukman  Bazarah, Senior Manager of Operations; and Janet Speaker, Camera Mastering  Manager. Other LexisNexis staff making important contributions include  Catherine Ferguson, who microfilmed the documents; Richard Milan, who made  numerous trips between New Jersey and Maryland to transport them; and the  quality control team under the direction of Faith Farmer, especially Eunice  Bond and Elaine Lawrence. Stephen Want, Director of Content Acquisition &amp;  Licensing, provided valuable assistance during the early stages of the project  by the arranging for the documents to be filmed at the&nbsp; LexisNexis facility. Numerous others  contributed as well, including Micah Calloway, Edgar O'Bannon, Kyle Tubbs, and  Shaun Woolcock. Among the staff at University Publications of America, Daniel  Lewis and Rosemary Orthmann worked closely with project staff on preparation of  the hard-copy guide. Mark Zimmerman copyedited and formatted the guide and  designed the cover. </p>
       
         <p>The microfilm edition  has benefitted from the work of several individuals whose names do not appear  on the title page. Eric Barry, Clare Hilliard, and Alexandra Rimer assisted  with the proofreading. Ms. Hilliard also participated in the addition of  reel-and-frame numbers to the database. Although they were not directly  involved in the editing of the microfilm edition, Associate Editor Louis  Carlat, former Assistant Editor David Hochfelder, and Business Manager Rachel  Weissenburger have made numerous indirect contributions. We wish especially to  acknowledge the contributions of the late Tony Cautillo, a former student and  volunteer for the Edison Papers in 2004-2005, who was involved in a number of  projects that significantly enhanced the value of our microfilm, book, and  online editions. </p>
         <p>A special debt of  gratitude is owed to the staff of the Special Collections of the Ellis Library  at the University of Missouri, Columbia,  and to its director, Michael E. Holland, for allowing Dr. Endersby the extended  use of their facilities to edit the notebooks and pocket notebooks that appear  in the Notebook Series. We are also grateful to the Thomas Edison National Historical Park for the loan of the microfilm that Dr. Endersby used to complete her  project. </p>
         <p>A special debt is owed  as well to Reese V. Jenkins, who served as Director and Editor of the Edison  Papers from its inception in 1978 until 1995 and his successor, Robert A.  Rosenberg, who served until 2001 and oversaw Part V through its early stages.  Two other former members of the Edison Papers&#151;Helen Endick, the longtime  Assistant to the Director, and Grace Kurkowski, our longtime Secretary&#151;also deserve a special note of appreciation for their years of hard work and  dedication.&nbsp; </p>
