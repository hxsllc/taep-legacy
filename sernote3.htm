caveats in Edison's hand and typed copies retained by Richard N. Dyer, Edison's patent attorney.



The individual caveats frequently deal with several technologies, including the phonograph, the



kinetograph, ore milling, and fluorescent lamps. The caveats bear a close relationship to the

infringement suit filed in 1898, details the early work on motion pictures undertaken at the West



Orange laboratory. The testimony and exhibits from this case were subsequently entered into



evidence in several infringement cases brought by Edison and his companies on his U.S. Patent



No. 589,168 and its reissue, No. 12,192. Additional items from two cases involving the reissued



patent have also been included, along with a set of letters to and from William K. L. Dickson,

Phonograph Company, Victor H. Emerson, and George E. Tewksbury</em> contains the record



of an



earlier case, <em>American Graphophone Company</em> v. <em>Edison Phonograph



Works,</em> which concerns



the basic phonograph patents of Edison and his rivals, Chichester A. Bell and Charles S. Tainter.



Several cases involving the patents granted to Edison's chemist, Jonas W. Aylsworth, have also



been selected. Other suits arose from the complicated business arrangements made between Jesse



Lippincott's North American Phonograph Company and various subsidiary companies. The most



important of these cases, <em>New York Phonograph Company</em> v.<em> National

<p>

The Document File is primarily a collection of incoming letters



addressed to Edison. There are



also letters addressed to Charles Batchelor, William E. Gilmore, John F. Randolph, Alfred O.



Tate, and other Edison associates. The letters frequently contain notations by Edison or his



secretaries indicating the nature of the reply. Occasional drafts of outgoing letters can also be



found in this file, along with unbound tissue copies (similar in character to the material in the



General Letterbook Series) and a variety of other documents such as intra-office memoranda,



reports, lists, circulars, and, occasionally, a laboratory sketch on the back of another document.</p>







<p>Many of the letters relate to the manufacture and marketing of



Edison's improved phonograph



and to legal and financial dealings among the various phonograph companies. Much of this



material pertains to the business of the North American Phonograph Company., which



controlled Edison's phonograph patents in the United States and Canada. This company served



as the exclusive marketing agent for the phonograph in North America from its establishment in



1888 until Edison forced it into bankruptcy in 1894. There are also numerous items from the late



1880s and early 1890s regarding the Edison Phonograph Toy Manufacturing Company, which



produced and marketed Edison's talking doll. A substantial portion of the Document File for the



late 1890s consists of documents relating to the activities of the Edison United Phonograph



Company, which handled the phonograph business in Great Britain and Continental Europe.
<p>During most of the period 1887&#150;1898, Edison continued to



maintain an interest in electric



lighting and power, and there are many letters relating to the technical and commercial



development of that technology. Among these are documents pertaining to the business of the



Edison Machine Works, the Edison Lamp Company, and the Edison Electric Light Company,



and to the affairs of various local illuminating companies, particularly the Edison Electric



Illuminating Company of New York and the Edison Electric Light Company of Philadelphia.



There is also material regarding the organization and operations of the Edison General Electric



Company, established in 1889, and its successor, the General Electric Company
<p>Other letters deal with mining and ore milling, the phonoplex



system of telegraphy, electric



traction systems, and the mimeograph. There is also correspondence pertaining to the technical



and commercial development of motion pictures. Among the documents for 1896 are a sizeable



number of letters concerning Edison's x-ray experiments. In addition to the business



correspondence, there are documents relating to Edison's personal finances and to his family



affairs. The "Edison, T.A.&#151;Family" folders for 1897 and 1898 contain numerous letters by



and



about Edison's oldest son, Thomas A. Edison, Jr.
<p>The documents are arranged by year and by subjects within each



year. Documents that deal with



more than one subject or that do not fall under any of the main subject categories are filed in the



"Edison, T.A.&#151;General" folder. Readers interested in a particular topic should always



consult



the various "General" folders in addition to more specific subcategories relating to their



interests. Undated documents that were likely generated within the year of attribution, along



with others that present no compelling evidence of being misfiled, remain within the main run of



dated folders. Undated documents for which no specific year can reasonably be conjectured are



filed in an "Undated Documents" folder at the end of the run of dated folders.
<p>Incoming correspondence and other unbound documents can also



be found in other series. See, particularly, the Company Records Series, Legal Series, Special Collections



Series, and Vouchers and Attached Correspondence Series.
<p>Explanatory targets



for both selected and unselected folders precede the documents for each year.</p>

<p>These letterbooks contain tissue copies of Edison's outgoing



correspondence. Although there are



occasional letters in Edison's hand, most of manuscript correspondence is in the hand of Edison's



secretaries. Similarly, the retained copies of Edison's typewritten letters are frequently signed or



initialed by one of his secretaries.</p>







<p>Many of the letters relate to the manufacture and marketing of



Edison's improved phonograph



and to legal and financial dealings among the various phonograph companies. In addition, there



are numerous documents pertaining to mining and ore milling and to the operations of Edison's



plant in Ogden, N.J. Included also are letters, many addressed to the Edison Machine Works and



the Edison General Electric Company, regarding Edison's work on improved filaments, meters,



and other components of his electric lighting system. Some of the documents relate to the



business of the Edison Manufacturing Company and to the production and promotion of the



Edison-Lalande primary battery. Other letters deal with Edison's phonoplex system of



telegraphy, electric traction systems, the mimeograph, and motion pictures. There are many



letters addressed to the law firm of Dyer &amp; Seely and to Edison's personal lawyer, Sherburne



B.



Eaton, concerning patent applications, interferences and infringements, and various other legal



concerns. In addition to the business correspondence, there are numerous letters relating to



Edison's personal finances and to family affairs.
<p>Copies of outgoing correspondence can also be found in the



Document File Series in folders



such as "Edison, T.A.&#151;Outgoing Correspondence" and "Edison,



T.A.&#151;Employment&#151;Outgoing

This series consists of articles, letters to the editor, and other items published in technical and scientific journals, popular magazines, and newspapers during the period 1862&ndash;1898. A comprehensive bibliography contains links to the works previously published in Parts I-III of the microfilm edition. Images of the original articles transcribed for the book edition will eventually be added.
