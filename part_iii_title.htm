            President, UPA Editorial; William Idol, Operations Manager, CIS Manufacturing;
            and camera operator Gloria Robinson. </P>

            acknowledgements with a special note of appreciation for two members of
            the staff who are absolutely central to the work of this project. Our Assistant
            to the Director, Helen Endick, and Secretary, Grace Kurkowski, are both
            highly talented and deeply devoted individuals. They perform their jobs
            in a truly outstanding manner and do a number of editorial, as well as
            administrative, tasks. Their talent, devotion, and good humor continue
            to greatly facilitate the work of this project.            <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
