            <h2><a name="sco"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Scope of the Edition</strong></h2>
            <p><font size=+2>A</font>ll of the documents appearing in Part III (1887-1898) are  from the archives at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park (ENHP) in West Orange, New    Jersey. Important documents for this time period also  exist in other repositories and private collections in the United States  and elsewhere. A selection of this material is available in the <u><a href="/snorep.htm">Outside  Repositories</a></u> edition  on the Edison Papers website.</p>
            <p><font size=+2>N</font>ot all of the documents appearing in Part III fit neatly  within its chronological limits. Notebooks, account books, and other bound  volumes that begin during the period 1887-1898 are published in their entirety  regardless of the date of the last entry. Thus, the minute book of the National  Phonograph Company, covering the period 1896&#8209;1910, appears in Part III, even  though the bulk of the entries are from a later period. Company record groups  that cut across the chronological boundaries of the edition are also sometimes  published as a unit. For example, the selected items from the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Concentrating  Works Records (1888&#8209;1911) all appear in Part III, since that company was active  primarily during the 1890s. Similarly, the Edison family correspondence,  donated to the ENHP by the Charles Edison Fund during the early 1990s, contains  numerous items from the period 1884&#8209;1886 as well as letters from 1887-1898.</p>
            <h2><a name="sel"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Selection of Documents</strong> </h2>
            <p><strong><font size=+2>G</font>eneral Principles</strong>. The edition as a whole will  encompass approximately 10 percent of the total number of extant Edison&#8209;related  documents. In general, the edition includes: (1) documents that Edison  generated or had prepared under his direction; (2) documents written by or sent  to Edison's principal laboratory and business associates; (3) correspondence  and other incoming documents containing substantial annotations by Edison; (4)  other important documents that Edison probably saw or was influenced by; and  (5) documents that contain significant information about Edison, his laboratory  and business associates, and their activities. Documents not selected include:  (1) routine financial documents such as bills, receipts, invoices, vouchers,  checks, and orders; (2) most of the day&#8209;to&#8209;day business records of the Edison  companies; and (3) unsolicited correspondence relating to matters outside the  mainstream of Edison's inventive, business,  and personal activities. In addition, dockets and endorsements entered onto the  back of correspondence, reports, and other unbound documents are not selected  unless they contain significant information not found in the document itself.</p>
              <p><font size=+2>M</font>ore specific selection information can be found in the  series and subseries targets and on the targets immediately preceding each  folder and bound volume in the digital edition.</p>
              <p><strong><font size=+2>S</font>election Principles for Part III</strong>. Part III contains  approximately 25 percent of the total documentation at the ENHP archives for  the period 1887-1898. All of the laboratory notebooks in Edison's hand were  selected, but a more stringent approach was taken for technical material by  experimenters other than Edison. Most of the  notebooks and related documents pertaining to experimental work done at the West Orange laboratory are selected. On the other hand,  routine items relating to the work performed by the laboratory in its role as  an auxiliary service arm for Edison's  manufacturing companies are not selected. Other technical documents are  excluded because they merely duplicate information in the selected documents.  For example, the extensive run of rough record books used by Arthur E. Kennelly  and his assistants in the Galvanometer Room at the West   Orange laboratory are not selected since transcriptions of those  records can be found in other notebooks in the edition.</p>
              <p><font size=+2>A</font>ll of Edison's important  business correspondence is included, as well as most of the ledger books,  journals, and other significant business records generated by the various  Edison&#8209;related companies. Among the types of business records not selected are  capital calls, meeting announcements, stock certificates, canceled checks and  check books, labor statements, routine statements relating to payment of taxes,  stationery and blank forms, letters of transmittal, and routine correspondence  with vendors and customers. Vouchers, cash books, trial balances, invoices, and  other financial records are not selected since the same information generally  can be found in the ledgers and journals.</p>
              <p><font size=+2>A</font> selective approach has also been taken in regard to the  voluminous collection of patent and litigation records. Since a complete set of  application files for Edison's successful U.S. patents is available on  microfilm (National Archives Record Group 241, Records of the Patent Office),  the lawyers' correspondence and most of the other material in the patent files  in the ENHP archives are not selected. However, notes and drawings in Edison's  hand are selected, together with the files for Edison's abandoned U.S.  applications. The extensive collection of foreign application files is not  selected. Printed records of civil court litigation are selected only in cases  where they provide significant information about Edison's  technical and business activities. &nbsp;</p>
              <p><font size=+2>A</font> substantial portion of the correspondence relating to the  domestic life and activities of Edison and his family is included, particularly  items dealing with his work schedule, his paternal and spousal roles, the  health of Edison and other family members, his relations with the Miller  family, and the activities of his daughter Marion and his sons Thomas and  William. Other categories of family&#8209;related documents are not selected:  correspondence pertaining to the purchase of household items, clothing, and  domestic services; telegrams regarding travel arrangements or the transmittal  of documents; solicitations and acknowledgments of annual dues and charitable  donations; and requests for loans.</p>
             
<h2><a name="org"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Organization and Arrangement of the Collections</strong></h2>
              <p><strong><font size=+2>G</font>eneral Principles</strong>. The digital edition is intended  to provide researchers with the most important documents in the ENHP archives  and with an entr&eacute;e to those documents not selected. Accordingly, the documents  are arranged in series that parallel existing record groups in the ENHP  archives&nbsp; The documents in many of the  larger series, such as the Notebook Series, are further arranged within  subseries. The Series Notes provide detailed descriptions of the contents of  each series and subseries.</p>
              <p><font size=+2>B</font>ecause of the size and complexity of the ENHP archives,  related documents can frequently be found in several series in the digital  edition. For example, while most of Edison's  incoming correspondence is filed in the Document File (Edison General File)  Series, other letters addressed to him appear in the Company Records Series,  Legal Series, Special Collections Series, and elsewhere. A more extensive  discussion of the relationships among the various series can be found in the  targets introducing each series in the digital edition. </p>
              <p><strong><font size=+2>O</font>rganization of Part III.</strong> The documents appear on the  microfilm in sixteen series, including five new series (in italics): (1)  Notebook Series, (2) <em>West Orange Laboratory Records Series</em>; (3) Patent  Series, (4) Litigation Series, (5) Document File Series, (6) General Letterbook  Series, (7) Miscellaneous Letterbook Series, (8) Legal Series, (9) <em>Published  Works and Other Writings</em>, (10) Scrapbook Series, (11) <em>Unbound Clippings  Series</em>, (12) Primary Printed Series, (13) Special Collections Series, (14)  Company Records Series, (15) <em>Vouchers and Attached Correspondence Series</em>,  and (16) <em>Family Records Series</em>. </p>
              <p><font size=+2>T</font>here is no Account Series for Part III. Instead, ledgers,  journals, and other accounting records can be found in the West Orange  Laboratory Records Series, Company Records Series, and Family Records Series.  Moreover, the Miscellaneous Scrapbook Series is now designated as the Scrapbook  Series, and the letterbooks are divided into two series. </p>
              <p><font size=+2>T</font>he standard-size (6&quot; x 9&quot;) books in the Notebook  Series are grouped into two subseries: Notebooks by Edison  and Notebooks by Other Experimenters. Within each subseries the books are  arranged according to their six-digit archival &quot;N-number&quot; which  generally corresponds to the earliest date in the book (see  &quot;Identification Numbers and Other Archival Inscriptions,&quot; below). The  pocket notebooks are organized by PN-number in a manner analogous to the  standard-size books. The eight notebooks by Arthur E. Kennelly, containing  transcriptions of material from the standard-size notebooks, are arranged by  volume number. The twelve miscellaneous notebooks generated between 1887 and  1899 appear in rough chronological order. The West Orange Laboratory Records  are arranged by document type (bound volumes, architectural drawings,  letterbooks, accounts) and then in rough chronological order or by volume number  (in the case of the Kennelly Letterbooks).</p>
              <h2><a name="tar"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Descriptive Targets</strong></h2>
              <p><font size=+2>T</font>argets are editorial aids that appear on the microfilm to  assist readers in using the materials in the collection. Targets introduce each  series, each major subseries, and most of the individual volumes and folders.  The series and subseries targets are essentially more detailed versions of the  Series Notes in the guide. The target preceding each folder or volume provides  information about authorship, inclusive dates, and number of pages (for bound  volumes). Also included is a description of the character and contents of the  folder or volume and, wherever appropriate, cross&#8209;references to related  materials. In addition, each target provides a brief characterization of any  material in the folder or volume that is not selected The targets preceding the  notebooks, account books, and most other bound volumes also contain an  enumeration of missing page numbers and of blank pages not filmed.</p>
              <p><font size=+2>O</font>ccasionally, targets also accompany individual documents in  order to: (1) explain relationships among documents (for example, the targets  &quot;ENCLOSURE&quot; and &quot;ATTACHMENT&quot;), (2) describe multiple  versions of a document (for example, the targets &quot;TRANSLATION FOLLOWS&quot;  and &quot;TRANSLATION&quot;), (3) supply missing information (for example, the  date or author of a letter), and (4) indicate missing information (the target  &quot;INCOMPLETE&quot;).</p>
              <p><font size=+2>T</font>he editors have tried to keep the targets as concise as  possible and to avoid including speculative and subjective judgments about the  contents of laboratory notebooks and other complicated technical documents.  References to specific technologies in the targets have necessarily resulted in  a certain amount of oversimplification because many of the technologies are interrelated.  The specific technologies mentioned in each target should not, therefore, be  regarded as all&#8209;inclusive.</p>
              <p><font size=+2>B</font>ecause of the large number of items in the edition and the  difficulty of anticipating the legibility of a document on the microfilm, targets  are not generally used to identify individual documents that are faint,  discolored, water&#8209;damaged, or otherwise difficult to read in the original. In  cases where a particular folder or volume contains a large number of such  documents, the problem is noted in the target introducing that folder or  volume. In the case of Edison's letterbooks,  all of which contain a substantial number of marginally legible documents, the  problem is also discussed in the target introducing the series.</p>
              <h2><a name="ide"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace=4 height=14 width=12 align=BOTTOM></a><strong>Identification Numbers and  Other Archival Inscriptions</strong></h2>
            <p><font size=+2>O</font>ver the years the archivists and curators responsible for  the Edison collections have used a variety of  identification systems for the documents. One of the earliest was the N&#8209;number,  which was assigned to most of the standard&#8209;size laboratory notebooks generated  between 1878 and 1934. This six&#8209;digit number, prefixed by the letter  &quot;N,&quot; corresponds to the first dated entry in the notebook. For  example, a notebook whose first dated entry is for November 9, 1878 is  classified as N&#8209;78&#8209;11&#8209;09. A similar number, with the prefix &quot;PN,&quot;  identifies each pocket notebook. Readers should be aware, however, that this  number is not always a reliable indicator of the date when a book was first put  to use. Many books were in use for a long period of time before any entry was  dated. Moreover, hundreds of books contain no date, and subsequent research has  indicated that many of the dates conjectured for such books are erroneous. For more information regarding
	N-numbers and other numbering systems used for Edison's notebooks, see
	the editorial note, &quot;<a href="/NamesSearch/glocpage.php?gloc=NA0000">Numbering Systems for Edison's Notebooks</a>.&quot;</p>
            
            <p><font size=+2>U</font>ntil 1971 the documents processed into the archives were  often assigned a sequential accession number prefixed by the letter  &quot;E.&quot; These E&#8209;numbers appear most often on notebooks, scrapbooks, and  other bound items, but they were also used occasionally for collections of  unbound documents and even individual items. After the National Park Service  assumed ownership of the archives in 1957, many of the documents were re&#8209;cataloged  and assigned NPS catalog numbers. Since that system is still in use at the  ENHP, all documents with NPS catalog numbers are identified in the microfilm  edition by that number. E&#8209;numbers are indicated only in cases of documents  lacking any other identifying number.</p>
            <p><font size=+2>M</font>oreover, the early archivists and curators of the Edison collections possessed no formal training in the  principles of archival management. Some of them did not consider it  inappropriate to record on the manuscripts their own observations about the  people, events, and issues discussed in the documents. Such comments sometimes  appear in the margins of the documents and, at other times, within the text  itself. Occasionally they are contained within brackets or parentheses, but  more often they appear without any distinguishing punctuation. Many of the  longer and more discursive remarks are followed by the initials  &quot;N.R.S.&quot; (Norman R. Speiden). In most cases, a reader who is aware of  this problem can easily distinguish between these comments and the actual text  of the document.</p>
