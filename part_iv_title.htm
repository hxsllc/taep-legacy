Representatives of the sponsoring institutions who have given support and direction to the project include: from Rutgers University, President Francis L. Lawrence, Vice-President Joseph J. Seneca, Dean Richard F. Foley, and History Department Chair David Oshinsky; from the National Park Service's Northeast Region, Regional Director Marie Rust and Museum Services Chief John Maounis; from the National Park Service's Edison National Historic Site, Superintendent Maryanne Gerbauckas, Assistant Superintendent Theresa Jung, and Supervisory Museum Curator Roger Durham; from the Smithsonian Institution, Curator Bernard S. Finn and Department Chair Arthur P. Molella; and from the New Jersey Historical Commission, Historian Howard L. Green. In addition, the editors are indebted to numerous former members of the Board of Sponsors, including Rudolph M. Bell, John Chambers, Kenneth Chandler, Ziva Galili, George Tselos, and Nancy Waters. </P>

Archivist Douglas Tarr and former chief archivist George Tselos have also provided important services to the project. Other present and former members of the archives processing staff who have assisted include John Attanasio, Henry Brown, Kathryn Bryan, Thomas and May Crooke, Todd Daniels-Howell, Robert Engel, James Fox, Rekha Gandhi, Alan Ginsburg, Marilyn Gisser, Steven Higgins, Emilie Jeanneney, Rebecca Johnson, John-Paul Richiuso, Madeline Rogers, Douglas Sterling, and Steven Ziolkowski.

Schallenberg, Janet Staiger, and Raymond Wile.</P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> special debt of gratitude is owed to Reese V. Jenkins, who served as director and editor of the Edison Papers from its inception in 1978 until 1995, and to whom this publication is dedicated.</P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he editors of the Edison Papers conclude their acknowledgments&mdash;as always&mdash;with a special note of appreciation for two longtime members of the staff whose names do not appear on the title page but who are absolutely central to the work of this project.

They are integral to all aspects of the project's work, and their good judgment and devotion have earned them the appreciation and trust of every editor past and present.
