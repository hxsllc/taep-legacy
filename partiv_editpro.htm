<h2><a name="sco" id="sco"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Scope of the Edition</strong></h2>
<p><i>Thomas A. Edison Papers: <span
class="GramE1">A Selective Microfilm Edition, Part IV (1899&#8209;1910) </i>is the fourth of a projected six&#8209;part
	facsimile edition of the correspondence, laboratory notebooks, and other papers
	of Thomas A. Edison. All of the documents microfilmed in Part IV are from the
	archives of the Thomas Edison National Historial Park (ENHP) in West Orange, New
	Jersey. Important documents for this time period also exist in other
	repositories in the United States and elsewhere. <span style="-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">A selection of this
	material can be found at <a href="/snorep.htm">/snorep.htm</a>. </p>
<p>Not all of the documents appearing
	in Part IV fit neatly within its chronological limits. Notebooks, account
	books, and other bound volumes that begin during the period 1899&#8209;1910 are
	filmed in their entirety regardless of the date of the last entry. An example
	is General Ledger #9 in the West Orange Laboratory Records Series, which covers
	the period 1908-1916. The records of many of the Edison companies in the Company
	Records Series extend beyond 1910, and in most cases selections have been made
	from the entire record group and not merely from the documents generated during
	the years 1899-1910.&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="sel" id="sel"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Selection of Documents</strong> </h2>
<p><i><strong>General Principles</strong></i>. The edition as a whole will
	encompass approximately 10 percent of the total number of extant Edison-related
	documents. In general, the edition includes: (1) documents that Edison
	generated or had prepared under his direction; (2) documents written by or sent
	to Edison's principal laboratory and business associates such as Frank L. Dyer,
	William E. Gilmore, and Walter S. Mallory; (3) incoming correspondence and
	other items containing substantial annotations by Edison; (4) other important
	documents that Edison probably saw or was influenced by; and (5) documents that
	contain significant information about Edison, his laboratory and business
	associates, and their activities. Documents that are not selected include: (1)
	routine financial documents such as bills, receipts, invoices, vouchers,
	checks, and orders; (2) most of the day&#8209;to&#8209;day business records of
	the Edison companies; and (3) unsolicited correspondence relating to matters
	outside the mainstream of Edison's inventive, business, and personal
	activities. </p>

class="GramE1"><i><span style='-size:11.0pt;-family:Arial'><strong>Selection
	Principles for Part IV</strong>.</i><span style='-size:11.0pt;
-family:Arial'> Part IV contains approximately 20 percent of the total
	documentation at the ENHP for the period 1899-1910. All of the laboratory
	notebook entries in Edison<span style='-size:11.0pt;-family:
&quot;WP TypographicSymbols&quot;;WP TypographicSymbols&quot;'><span
style='WP TypographicSymbols&quot;'>=s hand have been selected except for
	occasional perfunctory notations in notebooks by other experimenters. All of
	Edison's unbound notes and drawings have also been included except for a few
	rough notes and calculations for which no context is available.&nbsp; A more restrictive approach has been taken
	for notes and drawings by experimenters other than Edison. Notebooks and
	unbound material relating to experiments done at the West Orange laboratory
	have generally been selected, with the exception of the extensive runs of
	storage battery test books and other highly repetitive material. Samples consisting
	of entries that can be closely associated with Edison have been selected in
	these cases. Notebooks and unbound material pertaining to routine technical
	work done at the laboratory have generally not been selected. In many cases,
	these items represent the work performed by the laboratory in its role as an
	auxiliary service facility for Edison's manufacturing companies. Examples
	include the assays conducted on behalf of Edison's ore exploration and cement
	manufacturing endeavors and the qualitative analyses of chemicals required in
	the development and production of storage batteries.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All of Edison's important business
	correspondence has been selected, as well as most of the ledger books,
	journals, and other significant business records generated by the various
	Edison companies. The selected items reflect Edison's direct involvement in the
	affairs of his companies or pertain broadly to corporate policies or to
	administration and financial organization, but they do not reflect day-to-day
	operations. Among the types of business records not included are capital calls;
	meeting announcements; stock certificates; canceled checks and check books;
	labor statements; routine statements relating to payment of taxes; stationery
	and blank forms; letters of transmittal; and routine correspondence with
	vendors and customers. Vouchers, cash books, trial balances, invoices, and
	other financial records have not been filmed since the same information can
	often be found in the ledgers and journals. </p>
<p>A substantial portion of the
	correspondence relating to the domestic life and activities of Edison and his
	family is included, particularly items pertaining to Edison's work schedule,
	diet, and health; his paternal and spousal roles; his relations with the Miller
	Family; the charitable activities of Mina Miller Edison; and the business
	affairs of Thomas A. Edison, Jr., and William Leslie Edison.&nbsp; Other categories of family-related documents
	have not been filmed:&nbsp; correspondence
	pertaining to the purchase of household items, clothing, and domestic services;
	telegrams regarding travel arrangements or the transmittal of documents;
	solicitations and acknowledgments of annual dues and charitable donations; and
	requests for loans. </p>
<p>A restrictive approach has been
	taken in regard to the voluminous collection of patent and legal records. Since
	a complete set of application files for Edison's successful U.S. patents is
	already available on microfilm (National Archives Record Group 241, Records of
	the Patent Office), the formal specifications and attorneys' correspondence in
	the case files in the ENHP archives have not been filmed. The selected material
	from these files consists primarily of notes, drawings, and draft
	specifications by Edison, along with occasional correspondence to or from Edison,
	his associates, and his companies. On the other hand, the case files for
	Edison's abandoned or forfeited applications have been selected in their
	entirety except for duplicates, printed patents, and other printed material.&nbsp; Only a small proportion of the attorneys'
	correspondence, civil court records, and other material in the records of
	Edison's Legal Department <span class="GramE1">has been filmed. The
	selected items demonstrate Edison<span style='-size:11.0pt;
-family:&quot;WP TypographicSymbols&quot;;WP TypographicSymbols&quot;'><span style='WP TypographicSymbols&quot;'>=<span style='-size:11.0pt;
-family:Arial'>s direct involvement in the progress of litigation; pertain
	to experimental work performed by Edison or his associates; or broadly
	illustrate the business and legal strategies of his companies. </p>
<p>More specific information concerning
	the selection of documents in Part IV can be found in the series and subseries
	targets and on the targets immediately preceding the microfilmed folders and
	volumes. </p>
<h2><a name="org" id="org"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Organization and Arrangement of the Collections</strong></h2>

</p>
<p>The documents appear on the
	microfilm in series that parallel the record groups within the ENHP archives:
	(1) Notebook Series, (2) West Orange Laboratory Records Series, (3) Patent
	Series, (4) Document File Series, (5) General Letterbook Series, (6) Company
	Records Series, (7) Primary Printed Series, (8) Scrapbook Series, (9) Unbound
	Clippings Series,&nbsp; (10) Family Records
	Series, (11) Legal Series, and (12) Special Collections Series.&nbsp; Also included is a Supplement containing
	items from the period 1878-1898 that were uncovered subsequent to the
	publication of Part III. Within most series, the documents are further arranged
	into subseries. Detailed descriptions of the contents of each series and
	subseries can be found in the Series Notes in this guide. </p>
<p>In organizing the individual volumes
	and folders, the editors have generally followed the existing archival
	arrangement. Deviations between the archival order and the arrangement of the
	documents on the microfilm are noted on the targets introducing each series.
	Because Edison's laboratory notebooks are arranged in the ENHP archives
	according to an arbitrary N-number (see &quot;Identification Numbers and Archival
	Inscriptions&quot; below), the editors have imposed their own arrangement on
	this collection. See &quot;<a href="/NamesSearch/glocpage.php?gloc=N4A" target="_blank">Numbering, Arrangement, and Indexing of Notebooks</a>&quot; in the editorial
	introduction to the Notebook Series. </p>
<p>Because of the size and complexity
	of the ENHP archives, related documents can frequently be found in several
	series in the microfilm edition. For example, while most of Edison's incoming
	correspondence is filed in the Document File Series, other letters addressed to
	him appear in the Company Records Series and the Legal Series. Readers are
	advised to consult the Series Notes in this guide before using the microfilm
	edition. A more extensive discussion of the relationships among the various
	series can be found in the series targets. </p>
<h2><a name="tar" id="tar"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Descriptive Targets</strong></h2>
<p>Targets are editorial aids that
	appear on the microfilm to assist readers in using the materials in the
	collection. Targets introduce each series and subseries, as well as most of the
	individual volumes and folders. The series and subseries targets are
	essentially more detailed versions of the Series Notes in this guide. The
	target preceding each folder or volume provides information about authorship,
	inclusive dates, and number of pages (for bound volumes). Also included is a
	description of the character and contents of the folder or volume and, wherever
	appropriate, cross&#8209;references to related materials. In addition, each
	target provides a brief characterization of any material in the folder or
	volume that was not filmed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Occasionally, targets also accompany
	individual documents in order to: (1) explain relationships among documents
	(for example, the targets &quot;ENCLOSURE&quot; and &quot;ATTACHMENT&quot;);
	(2) describe multiple versions of a document (for example, the targets
	&quot;TRANSLATION FOLLOWS&quot; and &quot;TRANSLATION&quot;); (3) supply
	missing information (for example, the date or author of a letter); and (4)
	indicate missing information (the target &quot;INCOMPLETE&quot;). </p>
<p>The editors have tried to keep the
	targets as concise as possible and to avoid including speculative and
	subjective judgments about the contents of laboratory notebooks and other
	complicated technical documents. References to specific technologies in the
	targets have necessarily resulted in a certain amount of oversimplification
	because many of the technologies are interrelated. The specific technologies
	mentioned in each of the targets should not, therefore, be regarded as all&#8209;inclusive. </p>
<p>Because of the large number of items
	in the edition and the difficulty of anticipating the legibility of a document
	on the microfilm, targets are not generally used to identify individual
	documents that are faint, discolored, water&#8209;damaged, or otherwise
	difficult to read in the original. In cases where a particular folder or volume
	contains a substantial number of such documents, the problem is noted in the
	target introducing that folder or volume.&nbsp; In the case of Edison's letterbooks, all of which contain a substantial
	number of marginally legible documents, the problem is also discussed in the
	target introducing the series. </p>
<h2><a name="ide" id="ide"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Identification Numbers and  Other Archival Inscriptions</strong></h2>
<p>Over the years the archivists
	responsible for the collections at the ENHP have used a variety of
	identification systems for the documents. One of the earliest was the N&#8209;number,
	which was assigned to Edison's laboratory notebooks. This six&#8209;digit
	number, prefixed by the letter &quot;N,&quot; frequently corresponds to the
	first dated entry in the notebook.&nbsp; For
	example, a book whose first dated entry is from January 3, 1899, carries the
	number, N&#8209;99&#8209;01&#8209;03. Books with the same N&#8209;number are
	distinguished by an extension number (for example, N&#8209;01&#8209;07&#8209;01.1
	and N&#8209;01&#8209;07&#8209;01.2). A similar number, with the prefix
	&quot;PN,&quot; identifies each pocket notebook. These numbers are not reliable
	indicators of the date on which a book was put to into use. Some books were used
	for a long period before an entry was dated. Numerous other books contain no
	dated entries, and subsequent research has revealed that many of the dates
	conjectured for such books are erroneous. For more information regarding
	N-numbers and other numbering systems used for Edison's notebooks, see
	the editorial note, &quot;<a href="/NamesSearch/glocpage.php?gloc=NA0000">Numbering Systems for Edison's Notebooks</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Until 1971 the documents processed
	into the archives were often assigned a sequential accession number prefixed by
	the letter &quot;E.&quot; These E&#8209;numbers appear most often on notebooks,
	scrapbooks, and other bound items, but they were also used occasionally for
	collections of unbound documents and even individual items. After the National
	Park Service assumed ownership of the archives in 1957, many of the documents
	were re-cataloged and assigned NPS catalog numbers. Since that system is still
	in use at the ENHP, all documents with NPS catalog numbers are identified in
	the microfilm edition by that number. E&#8209;numbers are indicated only in
	cases of documents lacking any other identifying number. </p>
<p>Moreover, the early archivists and
	curators of the Edison collections possessed no formal training in the
	principles of archival management. Some of them did not consider it
	inappropriate to record on the manuscripts their own observations about the
	people, events, and issues discussed in the documents. These comments sometimes
	appear in the margins of the documents and, at other times, within the text
	itself.&nbsp; Occasionally they are contained
	within brackets or parentheses, but more often they appear without any
	distinguishing punctuation. Many of the longer and more discursive remarks are
	followed by the initials &quot;N.R.S.&quot; (Norman R. Speiden). In most cases,
	a reader who is aware of this problem can easily distinguish between these
	comments and the actual text of the document. </p>
