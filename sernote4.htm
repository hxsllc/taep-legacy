<p>The Document File is primarily a collection of incoming letters addressed to Edison. The letters frequently contain notations by Edison or his secretaries indicating the nature of the reply. Drafts and copies of outgoing letters can also be found in this file, along with a variety of other documents, such as memoranda, reports, and agreements. </p>

<p>The Document File for 1899-1910 contains a substantially larger amount of non-Edison correspondence than for earlier years. For example, there are numerous letters addressed to William E. Gilmore, who served until 1908 as president of the National Phonograph Co. and the Bates Manufacturing Co., as vice president of the Edison Manufacturing Co., and as general manager of the Edison Phonograph Works. In addition, there are numerous interoffice communications and carbon copies of Gilmore's outgoing correspondence. Many of the folders for 1908-1910 contain items from the office files of Frank L. Dyer, general counsel of the Legal Department, who succeeded Gilmore as the head of Edison's enterprises in July 1908. There are also letters to and from Edison's secretaries John F. Randolph and his successor, Harry F. Miller and other company and laboratory employees.</p>

<p>Many of the letters relate to the technical and commercial development of phonographs, motion pictures, and storage batteries. There are also items concerning the legal and financial dealings of the Edison companies, particularly the Edison Manufacturing Co. and the Edison Phonograph Works. Among the phonograph-related items are descriptions of the Works, memoranda regarding experimentation and model changes, and correspondence involving protracted litigation over sales rights. The material on motion pictures includes references to production and marketing, copyright and censorship issues, and experimentation with colored film and talking pictures. The battery-related correspondence pertains to the technical development and the domestic and foreign exploitation of Edison's alkaline storage battery, which he introduced in 1901 and continued to improve throughout the decade. Included are items regarding possible applications of the cells, particularly in automobiles and other electric vehicles. In addition, there are letters and other documents concerning the New Jersey Patent Co., a patent-holding company organized in 1903; the increasing centralization of Edison's businesses under the administrative aegis of the Legal Department and the Manufacturing and Executive Committees; and the formation of business associations or pools with the Edison Portland Cement Co.'s competitors and with motion picture producers and distributors.</p>

<p>During the period 1899-1910 Edison received an increasing number of unsolicited letters from aspiring inventors, individuals seeking autographs or charitable contributions, and others writing in response to published accounts of Edison's inventions, opinions, or experiences. Edison responded to some of these letters with marginal notations, in which he expresses his views on topics such as religion and spiritualism, hearing impairment, aviation and aerial navigation, and wireless telegraphy. Other marginal responses indicate his plans for a poured concrete house and his recollections of the details of his early years. In addition, there are items from clubs and societies to which Edison belonged or which tried to interest him in their activities, along with letters from journalists, entrepreneurs, and organizers of expositions and trade shows. Edison also received a substantial amount of correspondence from the general public as a result of his solicitations for information about the location of gold dry placer mines (1901-1904) and inexpensive supplies of cobalt ore (1906-1907).</p>

<p>There are also some letters relating to Edison's personal finances and family affairs. The "Edison, T.A.&#151;Family" folders contain numerous letters about the personal and financial difficulties of Edison's sons Thomas A. Edison, Jr., and William Leslie Edison, as well as the interests and activities of his second wife, Mina Miller Edison, and other members of his immediate and extended family. The "Glenmont" and "Fort Myers" folders contain items pertaining to Edison's home in Llewellyn Park, New Jersey, and his winter home in Florida.</p>

<p>The items in the Document File are arranged by year and are subdivided within each year according to broad subject categories. Many of those categories relate to technologies such as phonographs, storage batteries, and motion pictures. Documents that deal with more than one subject or that do not fall under any of the technology categories are filed in "Edison, T.A.&#151;General." Researchers interested in a particular topic should always consult "Edison, T.A.&#151;General" and the various other "General" folders in addition to more specific subcategories relating to their interests.</p>

<p>Incoming correspondence and other unbound documents can also be found in other series in the microfilm and digital editions. See, particularly, the Company Records Series, Legal Series, and Special Collections Series.</p>
