	<p>The Patent Series consists primarily of material
		
		relating to Edison's domestic and foreign patent applications. This material
		
		is organized into three categories: (1) Patent Application Files, (2) Patent
		
		Application Casebooks, and (3) Patent Application Drawings. The Patent
		
		Application Files contain specifications and related drawings, along with
		
		correspondence between Edison's attorneys and the U.S. Patent Office. The
		
		Patent Application Casebooks contain copies of the claims for Edison's
		
		U.S. patent applications for the period 1878-1884. The Patent Application
		
		Drawings consist primarily of tracings from the drawings that accompanied

	<p>The Litigation Series contains the printed records
		
		of civil court litigation, along with the records of Patent Office interferences,
		
		which are similar in many respects to litigation. During the 1880s Edison
		
		was involved in several patent interferences relating to his work in electric
		
		lighting. Of particular importance is the interference with William E.
		
		Sawyer and Albon Man relating to Edison's early work on electric lamps, which was later entered into the record in a patent
		
		infringement suit brought by the Edison Electric Light Company against the United States Lighting Company. Together,
		
		the patent interferences provide valuable information about Edison's work
		
		in electric lighting and power, electric traction, and duplex telegraphy,
		
		as well as documentation about the operation of the Menlo Park Laboratory.</p>

			<p><a href="sn02.htm#lit2">PRINTED COURT RECORDS</a></p>
		<dd>The printed court records for the period 1879-1886
				
				pertain to two separate cases. The earliest case involves a suit brought
				
				against Edison in 1880 by Lucy Seyfert, the wife of an investor who had
				
				loaned Edison money. The testimony in this case provides insight into Edison's
				
				relations with his financial backers and his financial difficulties during
				
				the mid-1870s. <br />
<br />
The patent infringement suit against Sawyer and
				
				Man&#151;<i>Edison Electric Light Company </i>v.<i> United States Electric Lighting
				
				Company&#151;</i>was the most important piece of electric light litigation brought
				
				by the Edison interests and the only electric light suit initiated prior
				
				to 1887. Included as exhibits in this case are parts of the printed record
				
				from the 1881 patent interference, <i>Sawyer and Man</i> v. <i>Edison</i>, and from two contemporary electric
				
				light cases: <i>Consolidated Electric Light Company</i> v. <i>McKeesport Light Company</i> (the "McKeesport Case") and <i>Edison Electric Light Company</i> v. <i>Westinghouse, Church, Kerr & Company</i> (the "Trenton Feeder Case"). These records
				
				constitute a particularly valuable source for documenting Edison's work
				
				in electric lighting. </p>

	<p>The Document File is primarily, but not exclusively,
		
		a collection of incoming correspondence. The correspondence frequently
		
		contains notes by Edison or one of his secretaries, indicating the nature
		
		of the reply. The folders comprised by this series also contain drafts and
		
		final copies of outgoing correspondence, as well as legal, financial, and
		
		patent-related documents. Legal material in the Document File includes
		
		agreements, incorporation papers, powers of attorney, proxies, depositions
		
		and other legal statements, and, occasionally, civil court records such
		
		as summonses and satisfactions of judgment. Financial material includes
		
		financial reports, unbound account sheets, bills, receipts, promissory
		
		notes, stocks, bonds, payrolls, and orders. Patent-related material includes
		
		patent applications, caveats (preliminary applications), and patent assignments.
		
		The Document File also contains a variety of other documents, such as memoranda,
		
		essays, reports, circulars, inventories and other lists, test reports,
		
		and, occasionally, a laboratory sketch on the back of another document.
		
		Dockets and endorsements frequently appear on the back of the incoming
		
		correspondence. They have been included only when they contain significant
		
		information not appearing on the document itself. </p>
	<p>The materials in the Document File for 1879-1886
		
		relate primarily to the invention and development of Edison's incandescent
		
		electric lighting system. Included is material dealing with both the technical
		
		and business aspects of electric lighting and power. Many of the documents
		
		pertain to the establishment of manufacturing and operating companies in
		
		the United States, Great Britain, France, Chile, and other countries in
		
		Asia, Europe, and South America. There are also numerous documents relating
		
		to Edison's platinum search, to his development of an ore separator, and
		
		to the establishment and operation of the Edison Ore Milling Company, Ltd.
		
		There is some material relating to the experimental electric railway at
		
		Menlo Park. </p>
	<p>In the folders for 1879-1882 there are a considerable
		
		number of documents pertaining to Edison's work on the telephone, particularly
		
		the establishment and consolidation of companies in Great Britain and France.
		
		For the years 1880-1882 there is a long run of correspondence between Edison
		
		and John Michels, the editor of <i>Science. </i>The folders for 1885-1886
		
		contain correspondence concerning the development of Edison's phonoplex
		
		system of railway telegraphy. There is also a small amount of material
		
		relating to other forms of telegraphy and a few documents about the phonograph.</p>
	<p>The documents are arranged by year. Within each
		
		year they are divided into broad subject categories such as electric light,
		
		telegraph, and telephone. These categories are frequently subdivided according
		
		to individual companies (for example, &quot;Electric Light&#151;Edison Electric
		
		Light Co&quot;). Sometimes a company folder is further subdivided according
		
		to function (for example, Electric Light&#151;Edison Electric Light Co&#151;Engineering
		
		Department&quot;). During the period 1883-1884 the Thomas A. Edison Construction
		
		Department installed central stations throughout the Northeast and Midwest,
		
		and documents relating to these stations can be found in folders such as
		
		&quot;Electric Light&#151;TAE Construction Dept&#151;Stations&#151;Massachusetts&#151;Brockton.&quot;
		
		For the years 1883 and 1884 there is also an extensive collection of outgoing
		
		correspondence from the Construction Department and other Edison companies,
		
		which can be found in &quot;Edison, T.A.&#151;Outgoing Correspondence.&quot;
		
		Documents relating to more than one subject or pertaining to personal matters
		
		or to topics not falling under the main subject categories can be found
		
		in the &quot;Edison, T.A.&#151;General&quot; folders. </p>

		added to the set, and older ones were periodically updated. The <a href="sernote1.htm#mps">first fifty-seven
		
		scrapbooks (Volumes 1-40)</a> are in Part I. The remaining scrapbooks (there
		
		were probably about 150 books at one time) contain clippings from the years
		
		1880 and 1881, along with scattered clippings from the years 1882-1889.
		
		Most of the books are less than half full, and they relate primarily to
		
		technical and scientific matters that were peripheral to Edison's own work.</p>
	<p>Only four scrapbooks, which contain significant
		
		material pertaining to Edison's activities, have been selected. Two of the
		
		books relate to Edison's exhibit at the Paris Electrical Exhibition of
		
		1881. One deals with Edison's patent litigation and with other patent-related
		
		matters. The remaining scrapbook contains miscellaneous clippings about
		
		Edison. Most of the clippings in the Menlo Park scrapbooks are from technical
		
		and scientific journals, although some are from popular magazines and newspapers.</p>

				1871-1909</a></p>
				
	<dl><dd>This extensive collection consists of the personal, laboratory, and business records of Charles Batchelor (1845-1910), one of Edison's closest associates during the 1870s, 1880s, and early 1890s. The documents are arranged in seven series: (1) Journals; (2) Notebooks; (3) Patents; (4) Unbound Documents; (5) Letterbooks; (6) Accounts; (7) Scrapbooks.
		<dt><b>Journals, 1877-1908</b>
		<dd>These volumes contain a daily record of Batchelor's
			
			personal and professional activities during much of the period between
			
			1877 and 1908. The entries deal extensively with Edison, his inventions,
			
			and his businesses. The last book in the set contains reminiscences by
			
			Batchelor about several of Edison's principal inventions.
		<dt>Notebooks, 1874-1909
		<dd>These books contain notes and drawings relating
			
			to experiments conducted by Batchelor, Edison, and others during the years
			
			1874-1909. The two earliest books deal with a wide range of topics including
			
			electric lighting, the electric pen, the phonograph, telegraphy, and telephony.
			
			The remaining books are primarily concerned with electric lighting experiments.
			
			A few notebooks also contain entries pertaining to ore milling and miscellaneous
			
			other technologies from the late 1880s through the first decade of the
			
			twentieth century. </dd>
		<dt>Patents, 1872-1880
		<dd>The one item selected in this series is a volume
			
			containing printed copies of Edison's British patents for the years 1872-1880.
			
			The patents relate to several inventions, including printing, automatic,
			
			and multiplex telegraphs; the electric pen and autographic press; the telephone;
			
			electric lighting; and polyform. Many of the specifications are accompanied
			
			by drawings. </dd>
		<dt>Unbound Documents, 1871-1905
		<dd>The correspondence and other unbound documents
			
			relate primarily to Batchelor's work with Edison during the period 1878-1898.
			
			Most of the material concerns Batchelor's activities during the 1880s as
			
			manager of the Edison electric light interests in France (1881-1884) and
			
			as manager of the Edison Machine Works (1884-1888). A few documents pertain
			
			to Batchelor's work as Edison's principal laboratory assistant and to the
			
			operations of the Edison Phonograph Works. Important correspondents include
			
			Edison, Francis R. Upton, Jay Gould, Henry Villard, and Cyrus W. Field.
			
			Included among the correspondence are a substantial number of letters about
			
			the phonograph, which were sent to Edison in 1878. In addition to the correspondence,
			
			there is a considerable amount of technical material, much of it in Edison's
			
			hand. Included also are agreements by Edison for rights to his electric
			
			pen, phonograph, and telephone, along with additional agreements concerning
			
			royalties owed to Batchelor for his assistance in developing these inventions;
			
			some financial documents, mostly relating to Batchelor's personal finances;
			
			and a memoir by Batchelor, written about 1905, regarding Edison's early
			
			work on incandescent lighting during the fall of 1878. </dd>
		<dt>Letterbooks, 1875-1890
		<dd>These letterbooks contain copies of Batchelor's
			
			personal and business correspondence. Many of the letters pertain to Edison,
			
			his inventions, and his businesses. Among the topics discussed are the
			
			removal of Edison and his laboratory to Menlo Park in 1876, the operations
			
			of the electric pen business, and work on telegraphy and telephony during
			
			the mid-1870s. Included also are letters dealing with Edison's electric
			
			lighting experiments, the operations of his various electric light companies,
			
			and the electric lighting business in Europe. The last book concerns the
			
			equipping of Edison's West Orange laboratory. </dd>
		<dt>Accounts, 1878-1888
		<dd>The one item selected in this series is an account
			
			book containing financial records of Charles and Rosanna Batchelor. The
			
			entries relate to Batchelor's accounts with Edison, the Edison Lamp Company,
			
			the Edison Machine Works, Bergmann &amp; Company, and other domestic and foreign
			
			lighting companies. Included are records of patent royalties, stock dividends,
			
			and other payments resulting from Batchelor's interests in Edison's companies
			
			and inventions. </dd>
		<dt>Scrapbooks, 1876-1893
		<dd>The clippings and other items in these scrapbooks
			
			relate primarily to Edison and his inventions during the years 1876-1893.
			
			Most of the clippings in the first book deal with Edison's telephone and
			
			phonograph. The clippings in the remaining books relate primarily to Edison's
			
			work on electric lighting. There are also a few clippings pertaining to
			
			other topics such as the opening of Edison's West Orange laboratory, his
			
			work on ore milling, and the development of the improved phonograph. The
			
			last scrapbook contains letters and cables from 1881 and 1882 relating to the
			
			Paris Electrical Exhibition of 1881 and to electric lighting in Europe.</dd>

			1878-1918</a></p>
	<dd>This collection contains the personal, laboratory,
		
		and business records of Francis Robbins Upton (1853-1921), who played a major role in the
		
		development of Edison's incandescent lighting system. Among the earliest
		
		documents are three notebooks. One was kept by Upton during the summer
		
		of 1878 while he was a student of Hermann von Helmholtz. The others were
		
		used during the fall of 1878 while he was conducting a literature search
		
		for the Edison Electric Light Company. The remainder of the collection
		
		consists of correspondence and other unbound documents. Upton's correspondence
		
		from the period 1878-1880, written primarily to members of his family,
		
		is an invaluable source of information about the early stages of the incandescent
		
		lamp. The later material deals primarily with the business of the Edison
		
		Lamp Company, of which Upton was general manager. The post-1900 items include
		
		a note from Edison about the fire at the Edison Phonograph Works, Upton's
		
		notes about Edison for a speech at the first Edison Pioneers' meeting in
		
		1918, and a membership list of the Pioneers. </dd>
