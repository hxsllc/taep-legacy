		<h2><a name="sco" id="sco"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Scope of the Edition</strong></h2>
		<p>All of the documents appearing in Part II (1879-1886) are  from the archives at the Edison National Historical Park (ENHP) in West Orange, New    Jersey. Important documents for this time period also  exist in other repositories and private collections in the United States  and elsewhere. A selection of this material is available in the <u><a href="/snorep.htm">Outside  Repositories</a></u> edition   on the Edison Papers website.</p>
		<p>Not all of the documents appearing in Part II fit neatly  within its chronological limits. Notebooks, account books, and other bound  volumes that begin during the period 1879-1886 are presented in their entirety  regardless of the date of the last entry. For example, there are several  volumes in the Account Series that begin in the early 1880s and continue  through the 1890s. Many of the documents in the eight-volume set of litigation  records relating to Edison's patent infringement suit against William E. Sawyer  and Albon Man (<em>Edison Electric Light Company</em> v.<em> United States  Electric Lighting Company</em>) also date from the period after 1886. However,  these volumes are included in Part II because the suit itself was initiated in  1885 and because the events detailed by the testimony all occurred prior to  1887.</p>
		<p>Other groups of documents are also occasionally presented as  a unit, even though they cut across the chronological boundaries of the  edition. Included in the Special Collections Series, for example, are two  extensive collections of the papers of Edison's  principal associates, Charles Batchelor and Francis R. Upton. Although the  majority of items in both collections date from the period 1878-1886, the  documents span the years 1871-1918. In order to preserve the integrity of these  important collections, all of the selected items are presented in Part II.</p>
		<h2><a name="sel" id="sel"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Selection of Documents</strong>                 </h2>
		<p><strong>General Principles</strong>. The edition as a whole will  encompass approximately 10 percent of the total number of extant Edison&#8209;related  documents. In general, the edition includes: (1) documents that Edison  generated or had prepared under his direction; (2) documents written by or sent  to Edison's principal laboratory and business associates; (3) correspondence  and other incoming documents containing substantial annotations by Edison; (4)  other important documents that Edison probably saw or was influenced by; and  (5) documents that contain significant information about Edison, his laboratory  and business associates, and their activities. Documents not selected include:  (1) routine financial documents such as bills, receipts, invoices, vouchers,  checks, and orders; (2) most of the day&#8209;to&#8209;day business records of the Edison  companies; and (3) unsolicited correspondence relating to matters outside the  mainstream of Edison's inventive, business,  and personal activities. In addition, dockets and endorsements entered onto the  back of correspondence, reports, and other unbound documents are not selected  unless they contain significant information not found in the document itself.</p>
		<p>More specific selection information can be found in the  series and subseries targets and on the targets immediately preceding each  folder and bound volume in the digital edition.</p>
		<p><strong>Selection Principles for Part II</strong>. Part II contains  approximately 50 percent of the total documentation at the ENHP archives for  the period 1879-1886. All of Edison's  important business correspondence and almost all of the laboratory notebooks  are included. On the other hand, routine financial documents, routine business  correspondence, and unsolicited letters to Edison  generally were not selected. In addition, numerous documents were excluded  because the information contained within them merely duplicated the information  in other, selected documents. For example, the copies of claims for Edison's  issued patents found in the three patent application casebooks in the Patent  Series were not selected because the complete set of Edison's U.S. patents is  already available. At the same time, the copies of the claims for abandoned and  rejected patent applications were selected because this information cannot  easily be found elsewhere.</p>
		<p>The notebooks, account books, litigation records, and other  bound volumes are generally presented in their entirety. However, routine  business correspondence in the letterbooks was not selected, and overlapping  and multipage clippings in the scrapbooks are presented in their entirety only  when they relate directly to the affairs to Edison. </p>
		<h2><a name="org" id="org"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Organization and Arrangement of the Collections</strong></h2>
		<p><strong>General Principles</strong>. The digital edition is intended  to provide researchers with the most important documents in the ENHP archives  and with an entr&eacute;e to those documents not selected. Accordingly, the documents  are arranged in series that parallel existing record groups in the ENHP archives&nbsp; The documents in many of the larger series,  such as the Notebook Series, are further arranged within subseries. The Series  Notes provide detailed descriptions of the contents of each series and  subseries.</p>
		<p>Because of the size and complexity of the ENHP archives,  related documents can frequently be found in several series in the digital  edition. For example, while most of Edison's  incoming correspondence is filed in the Document File (Edison General File)  Series, other letters addressed to him appear in the Company Records Series,  Legal Series, Special Collections Series, and elsewhere. A more extensive  discussion of the relationships among the various series can be found in the  targets introducing each series in the digital edition. </p>
		<p><strong>Organization of Part II.</strong> The documents appear on the  microfilm in eleven series: (1) Notebook Series, (2) Patent Series, (3)  Litigation Series, (4) Document File Series, (5) Letterbook Series, (6) Legal  Series, (7) Account Series, (8) Menlo Park Scrapbook Series, (9) Miscellaneous  Scrapbook Series, (10) Special Collections Series, and (11) Company Records  Series. </p>
		<p>The standard&#8209;size (6&quot; x 9&quot;) books in the Notebook  Series are grouped into four subseries according to their provenance: Menlo  Park Notebooks, New York Notebooks, Fort Myers Notebooks, and Lamp Factory  Notebooks. The 181 Menlo Park Notebooks are organized according to Edison's original numbering system, whereas the other  groups of standard&#8209;size notebooks are arranged in chronological order. </p>
		<p>In the case of the letterbooks, a distinction has been made  between the general series of books (General Letterbooks subseries) and more  specialized letterbooks generated by the Edison Ore Milling Co., the Thomas A.  Edison Construction Dept., and other companies (Miscellaneous Letterbooks  subseries). The books in the Account Series are organized according to type  (laboratory accounts, family accounts, etc.) and then suborganized into summary  accounts, books of original entry, and cost accounts. </p>
		<h2><a name="tar" id="tar"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Descriptive Targets</strong></h2>
		<p>Targets are editorial aids that appear on the microfilm to  assist readers in using the materials in the collection. Targets introduce each  series, each major subseries, and most of the individual volumes and folders.  The series and subseries targets are essentially more detailed versions of the  Series Notes in the guide. The target preceding each folder or volume provides  information about authorship, inclusive dates, and number of pages (for bound  volumes). Also included is a description of the character and contents of the  folder or volume and, wherever appropriate, cross&#8209;references to related  materials. In addition, each target provides a brief characterization of any  material in the folder or volume that is not selected The targets preceding the  notebooks, account books, and most other bound volumes also contain an  enumeration of missing page numbers and of blank pages not filmed.</p>
		<p>Occasionally, targets also accompany individual documents in  order to: (1) explain relationships among documents (for example, the targets &quot;ENCLOSURE&quot;  and &quot;ATTACHMENT&quot;), (2) describe multiple versions of a document (for  example, the targets &quot;TRANSLATION FOLLOWS&quot; and  &quot;TRANSLATION&quot;), (3) supply missing information (for example, the date  or author of a letter), and (4) indicate missing information (the target  &quot;INCOMPLETE&quot;).</p>
		<p>The editors have tried to keep the targets as concise as  possible and to avoid including speculative and subjective judgments about the  contents of laboratory notebooks and other complicated technical documents.  References to specific technologies in the targets have necessarily resulted in  a certain amount of oversimplification because many of the technologies are  interrelated. The specific technologies mentioned in each target should not,  therefore, be regarded as all&#8209;inclusive.</p>
		<p>Because of the large number of items in the edition and the  difficulty of anticipating the legibility of a document on the microfilm,  targets are not generally used to identify individual documents that are faint,  discolored, water&#8209;damaged, or otherwise difficult to read in the original. In  cases where a particular folder or volume contains a large number of such  documents, the problem is noted in the target introducing that folder or  volume. In the case of Edison's letterbooks,  all of which contain a substantial number of marginally legible documents, the  problem is also discussed in the target introducing the series.</p>
		<h2><a name="ide" id="ide"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Identification Numbers and  Other Archival Inscriptions</strong></h2>
		<p>Over the years the archivists and curators responsible for  the Edison collections have used a variety of  identification systems for the documents. One of the earliest was the N&#8209;number,  which was assigned to most of the standard&#8209;size laboratory notebooks generated  between 1878 and 1934. This six&#8209;digit number, prefixed by the letter &quot;N,&quot;  corresponds to the first dated entry in the notebook. For example, a notebook  whose first dated entry is for November 9, 1878 is classified as N&#8209;78&#8209;11&#8209;09. A  similar number, with the prefix &quot;PN,&quot; identifies each pocket  notebook. Readers should be aware, however, that this number is not always a  reliable indicator of the date when a book was first put to use. Many books  were in use for a long period of time before any entry was dated. Moreover,  hundreds of books contain no date, and subsequent research has indicated that  many of the dates conjectured for such books are erroneous. For more information regarding
	N-numbers and other numbering systems used for Edison's notebooks, see
	the editorial note, &quot;<a href="/NamesSearch/glocpage.php?gloc=NA0000">Numbering Systems for Edison's Notebooks</a>.&quot;</p>
		<p>Until 1971 the documents processed into the archives were  often assigned a sequential accession number prefixed by the letter  &quot;E.&quot; These E&#8209;numbers appear most often on notebooks, scrapbooks, and  other bound items, but they were also used occasionally for collections of  unbound documents and even individual items. After the National Park Service  assumed ownership of the archives in 1957, many of the documents were re&#8209;cataloged  and assigned NPS catalog numbers. Since that system is still in use at the  ENHP, all documents with NPS catalog numbers are identified in the microfilm  edition by that number. E&#8209;numbers are indicated only in cases of documents  lacking any other identifying number.</p>
		<p>Moreover, the early archivists and curators of the Edison collections possessed no formal training in the  principles of archival management. Some of them did not consider it  inappropriate to record on the manuscripts their own observations about the  people, events, and issues discussed in the documents. Such comments sometimes  appear in the margins of the documents and, at other times, within the text  itself. Occasionally they are contained within brackets or parentheses, but  more often they appear without any distinguishing punctuation. Many of the  longer and more discursive remarks are followed by the initials  &quot;N.R.S.&quot; (Norman R. Speiden). In most cases, a reader who is aware of  this problem can easily distinguish between these comments and the actual text  of the document.</p>
