<h2><a name="sco" id="sco"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Scope of the Edition</strong></h2>
<p><i>Thomas A. Edison Papers: A Selective Microfilm Edition, Part V (1911-1919) </i>is the fifth of a
	projected six&#8209;part facsimile edition of the correspondence, laboratory
	notebooks, and other papers of Thomas A. Edison. The edition will ultimately
	consist of approximately 350,000 images of which 285,775 images are now
	available on microfilm or online. All of the documents in Part V are from the
	archives of the Thomas Edison National Historical Park (ENHP) in West Orange, New Jersey.
	Important documents for this time period also exist in other repositories and
	private collections in the United States and elsewhere. A selection of this
	material can be found at <a href="/snorep.htm">/snorep.htm</a>. </p>
<p>Not all of the documents appearing in
	Part V fit exactly within its chronological limits. The laboratory notebooks,
	which were edited before the chronological boundaries of Part V were defined,
	are selected through 1920. A few notebooks from the early and mid-1920s also
	appear in Part V because they are part of a group or subgroup beginning in 1920
	or earlier. Many of the record groups in the ENHP archives are not
	chronologically organized and, in those cases, selections have been made from
	the entire record group and not merely from the documents generated during the
	years 1911-1919. The Part V record groups selected
	through 1931 are: Patent Series, Naval Consulting Board and Related Wartime
	Research Papers, Chemical Production Records, Harry F. Miller File, Richard W. Kellow File, Charles Edison Fund Collection, and Edison
	Family Papers. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some
	important documents from 1911-1919 that do not appear in Part V. For
	example, selections from the corporate records of the Edison Storage Battery
	Co. and the Edison Portland Cement Co. can be found in the Company Records
	Series in Part IV. The divisional record groups of Thomas A. Edison, Inc.
	(e.g., Phonograph Division, Recording Division, Motion Picture Division), most
	of which cover the entire period 1911-1931, were not completely processed at
	the time Part V was edited and will therefore be published in Part VI. </p>
<h2><a name="sel" id="sel"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Selection of Documents</strong> </h2>
<p><i><strong>General Principles</strong></i><strong>.</strong> The microfilm edition as a whole will
	encompass approximately 10 percent of the extant Edison-related documents. In
	general, the edition includes: (1) documents that Edison generated or had
	prepared under his direction; (2) documents written by or sent to Edison's
	principal laboratory and business associates; (3) incoming correspondence and
	other items containing substantive annotations by Edison; (4) other important
	documents that Edison probably saw or was influenced by; and (5) documents that
	contain significant information about Edison, his laboratory and business
	associates, and their activities. Documents that are not selected include: (1)
	routine financial documents such as bills, receipts, invoices, vouchers,
	checks, and orders; (2) most of the day&#8209;to&#8209;day business records of
	the Edison companies; and (3) unsolicited correspondence relating to matters
	outside the mainstream of Edison's inventive, business, and personal activities
	that received no response or merely a form-letter response from Edison. </p>
<p><i><strong>Selection Principles for Part V.</strong></i> The number of documents in the ENHP
	archives increases dramatically for the period after the formation of Thomas A.
	Edison, Inc., in 1911. Indeed, probably two-thirds of the documents were generated
	during those years. In order to expedite the publication of Part V and to keep
	it within a manageable size, some changes were made in selection strategy. The
	core collections&#151;Edison General File, Notebooks, Patents,
	Scrapbooks and Clippings, Legal Files, and Family Papers&#151;remain
	unaffected. For the voluminous collections of business records that constitute
	the bulk of the ENHP archives, however, a more restrictive approach has been
	taken and only those documents that explicate Edison's own involvement in
	company operations have been selected. For example, the ledgers, journals, and
	other general account books, which comprised several reels in each of the
	previous parts of the microfilm edition, were not selected in Part V. However,
	accounting records that bear Edison's marginalia or otherwise indicate his
	personal involvement can still be found in the Edison General File and other
	series on the microfilm. </p>
<p>As in previous parts of the microfilm
	edition, all of the laboratory notebooks in Edison's hand have been selected
	(&quot;Notebooks by Edison&quot;), as well as most of the books that are part
	of a series of experiments in which Edison was directly involved
	(&quot;Notebooks by Edison and Other Experimenters&quot;). A much more
	restrictive approach was taken in regard to the 796 notebooks that were not
	authored by Edison (&quot;Notebooks by Experimenters Other Than Edison&quot;).
	Only sixty-four books, which either have clear indications of Edison's
	oversight and involvement or contain loose items authored by Edison, have been
	selected. </p>
<p>All of Edison's important business
	correspondence has been selected, along with other documents that reflect his
	direct involvement in the affairs of his companies or pertain broadly to
	corporate policies or to administration and financial organization. Among the
	types of business records not included are capital calls; meeting
	announcements; stock certificates; canceled checks and check books; labor
	statements; routine statements relating to payment of taxes; stationery and
	blank forms; letters of transmittal; and routine correspondence with vendors
	and customers. </p>
<p>A substantial portion of the
	correspondence relating to the domestic life and activities of Edison and his
	family is included, particularly items pertaining to Edison's work schedule,
	diet, and health; his paternal and spousal roles; his relations with the Miller
	Family; the charitable activities of Mina Miller Edison; and the activities of
	his children. Other categories of family-related documents have not been
	filmed: correspondence about the purchase of household items, clothing, and
	domestic services; telegrams regarding travel arrangements or the transmittal
	of documents; solicitations and acknowledgments of annual dues and charitable
	donations; and requests for loans. </p>
<p>A restrictive approach has been taken in
	regard to the voluminous collection of patent records. The case files for
	foreign patent application files have not been selected. Moreover, since a
	complete set of application files for Edison's successful U.S. patents is
	already available on microfilm (National Archives Record Group 241, Records of
	the Patent Office), the formal specifications and attorneys' correspondence in
	the case files in the ENHP archives have not been filmed. The selected material
	from these files consists primarily of notes, drawings, and draft
	specifications by Edison, along with occasional correspondence to or from
	Edison, his associates, and his companies. Because they are not part of the
	Patent Office records in the National Archives, the case files for Edison's
	abandoned and forfeited applications have been selected in their entirety
	except for duplicates, printed patents, and other printed material. </p>
<p>More specific information concerning the
	selection of documents in Part V can be found in the editorial notes preceding
	each series and subseries on the microfilm and in the
	notes preceding each microfilmed folder and volume. </p>
<h2><a name="org" id="org"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Organization and Arrangement of the Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The documents appear on the microfilm in
	series that parallel the record groups within the ENHP archives: (1) Notebook
	Series, (2) Patent Series, (3) Edison General File Series, (4) General Letterbook Series, (5) Special Collections Series, (6)
	Legal Series, (7) Family Records Series, (8) Scrapbook Series, and (9) Unbound
	Clippings Series. The Special Collection Series for Part V consists of
	selections from two record groups: (1) Naval Consulting Board and Related
	Wartime Research Papers; and (2) Chemical Production Records. Detailed
	descriptions of the contents of each series and subseries can be found in the Series Notes in this guide and in the editorial notes on
	the microfilm. </p>
 
<p>In organizing
	the individual volumes and folders, the editors have generally followed the
	existing archival arrangement. Deviations between the archival order and the
	arrangement of the documents on the microfilm are indicated on the editorial
	notes introducing each series. The most detailed discussions can be found in
	the introductions to the <a target=_blank href="/NamesSearch/glocpage.php?gloc=E05">Edison General File</a> (formerly Document File) and the
	<a target=_blank href="/NamesSearch/glocpage.php?gloc=MF00">Naval Consulting Board and Related Wartime Research Papers</a>. Because Edison's laboratory notebooks are arranged in the
	ENHP archives according to an arbitrary N-number (see &quot;Identification
	Numbers and Archival Inscriptions&quot; below), the editors have imposed their
	own arrangement on this collection, paralleling the arrangement in Part IV of
	the microfilm edition. </p>
<p>Because of the size and complexity of the
	ENHP archives, related documents can frequently be found in several series in
	the microfilm edition. For example, while most of Edison's incoming
	correspondence and drafts of outgoing letters are filed in the Edison General
	File Series, other letters appear in the Special Collections Series, Legal
	Series, and Family Records Series. Tissue copies of Edison's outgoing
	correspondence can be found not only in the General Letterbook Series but also in the other series mentioned above. While correspondence
	pertaining to Edison's wartime research for the U.S. government is filed
	primarily in the Naval Consulting Board and Related Wartime Research Papers
	(Special Collections Series), similar material can be found in the Edison
	General File Series in folders such as &quot;Naval Consulting Board,&quot;
	&quot;Naval Experiments,&quot; and &quot;World War ICExperimental
	Work.&quot; A more extensive discussion of the relationships among the various
	series can be found in the editorial notes introducing each series on the
	microfilm. </p>
<h2><a name="tar" id="tar"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Descriptive Targets</strong></h2>
<p>Approximately 1,400 editorial notes (or
	&quot;targets&quot;) appear in the Part V microfilm edition to assist
	researchers in using the materials in the collections. Targets introduce each
	series and subseries, as well as each selected volume
	or folder. The series and subseries targets are
	essentially more detailed versions of the Series Notes in this guide. The
	target preceding each folder or volume provides information about authorship,
	inclusive dates, and number of pages (for bound volumes). Also included is a
	description of the character and contents of the volume or folder, cross&#8209;references
	to related materials, an estimate of the percentage of documents selected, and
	a characterization of material not filmed. </p>
<p>Targets are also used to enumerate and
	describe folders and volumes that were not filmed. For example, each of the 205
	unselected folders in the Edison General File Series is represented on the
	microfilm by a descriptive target. Each of the 950 experimental notebooks
	comprised in the Notebook Series is also listed in a group or subgroup target.
	Subgroups that consist entirely of unselected notebooks are indicated by an
	asterisk in the Series Notes; in such cases, the reel and frame designation
	directs the researcher to the explanatory note. </p>
<p>Targets also accompany individual
	documents in order to: (1) explain relationships among documents (for example,
	&quot;ATTACHMENT/ENCLOSURE&quot;); (2) describe multiple versions of a document
	(for example, &quot;TRANSLATION FOLLOWS&quot; and &quot;TRANSLATION&quot;); and
	(3) indicate missing information (&quot;INCOMPLETE&quot;). </p>
<p>The editors have tried to keep the
	targets as concise as possible and to avoid including speculative and
	subjective judgments about the contents of laboratory notebooks and other
	complicated technical documents. References to specific technologies in the
	targets have necessarily resulted in a certain amount of oversimplification
	because many of the technologies are interrelated. The specific technologies
	mentioned in each of the targets should not, therefore, be regarded as all&#8209;inclusive. </p>
<p>Because of the large number of items in
	the edition and the difficulty of anticipating the legibility of a document on
	the microfilm, targets are not used to identify individual documents that are
	faint, discolored, water&#8209;damaged, or otherwise difficult to read in the
	original. In cases where a particular folder or volume contains a substantial
	number of such documents, the problem is noted in the introductory target. </p>
<h2><a name="ide" id="ide"></a><a href="#top"><img src="xuparrw.gif" hspace="4" height="14" width="12" align="bottom" /></a><strong>Identification Numbers and  Other Archival Inscriptions</strong></h2>
<p><b>N-numbers.</b> During the late 1930s archivists at the
	West Orange laboratory began assigning six&#8209;digit numbers, prefixed by the
	letter &quot;N,&quot; to Edison's laboratory notebooks. Frequently this number
	corresponds to the first dated entry in the book. For example, a book whose first
	dated entry is from July 28, 1912, carries the number, N&#8209;12&#8209;07&#8209;28.
	Books with the same N&#8209;number are distinguished by an extension number
	(for example, N&#8209;12&#8209;04&#8209;15.1 and N&#8209;12&#8209;04&#8209;15.2). </p>
<p>N-numbers are not reliable indicators of
	the date on which a notebook was put into use. Some books were used for a long
	period before an entry was dated. Other books contain no dated entries. Some of
	these undated books are indicated by the notation, &quot;N&#8209;Undated,&quot;
	followed by an extension number. For example, N&#8209;Undated.4 is a notebook
	that was probably used in 1916. For other undated books, a conjectured year
	serves as the first two digits of the N&#8209;number. For example, N&#8209;11&#8209;00&#8209;00.4
	indicates one of four notebooks believed to date from the year 1911. Subsequent
	research has revealed that some of these conjectured years are inaccurate. </p>
<p><b>PN&#8209;numbers.</b> As with the N&#8209;numbered notebooks,
	the six&#8209;digit number for the pocket notebooks frequently corresponds to
	the first dated entry in the book. Undated books are designated either by the
	notation &quot;PN&#8209;Undated&quot; or by a conjectured year. Some of these
	conjectured years are inaccurate. </p>
<p><b>E-numbers and NPS catalog numbers</b>. Until l97l the documents processed into
	the ENHP archives were often assigned a sequential accession number prefixed by
	the letter &quot;E.&quot; These E&#8209;numbers appear most often on notebooks,
	scrapbooks, and other bound items, but they were also used occasionally for
	collections of unbound documents and even individual items. After the National
	Park Service assumed ownership of the archives in 1957, many of these documents
	were re-cataloged and assigned NPS catalog numbers. Since that system is still
	in use, all documents with NPS catalog numbers are identified in the microfilm
	edition by that number rather than by E&#8209;numbers. </p>
<p><b>Archival
	Inscriptions.</b> It
	is not uncommon for documents in the Edison General File and other record
	groups to bear an archivist's inscription, sometimes enclosed within brackets
	or parentheses, at the top of the page. In most cases, the inscription refers
	to the folder in which the manuscript was to be filed. Since the collections
	have been reorganized numerous times over the years, these file names are
	frequently outdated. In the case of undated documents, a conjectured date
	(usually a year) sometimes appears at the top of the page. Subsequent research
	has revealed that some of these conjectured years are inaccurate. </p>
<p>The early archivists and curators of the
	Edison collections possessed no formal training in the principles of archival
	management. Some of them did not consider it inappropriate to record on the
	manuscripts their own observations about the people, events, and issues
	discussed in the documents. These comments sometimes appear in the margins of
	the documents and, at other times, within the text itself. Occasionally they
	are contained within brackets or parentheses, but more often they appear
	without any distinguishing punctuation. Many of the longer and more discursive
	remarks are followed by the initials &quot;N.R.S.&quot; (Norman R. Speiden). In most cases, a researcher who is aware of this
	problem can easily distinguish between these comments and the actual text of
	the document.</p>
