<p>This series contains correspondence, financial records, and other documents relating to the members of the Edison and Miller families. Most of the items pertain to the activities and interests of Edison's second wife, Mina Miller Edison, and to the maintenance of Glenmont, the Edison home in Llewellyn Park, New Jersey.</p>


<dl><dt><a name="ns5a" id="ns5a"></a><a href="sn11.htm#ns5a">NOTEBOOKS BY EDISON</a>

<dd>These standard-size (6" x 9") notebooks were used primarily by Edison, but there are occasional notes by other experimenters as well as numerous references to employees who assisted him in his work. The thirty-seven books for 1911-1916 consist primarily of notes and drawings pertaining to the development and manufacture of Blue Amberol and Diamond Disc records. There are also entries regarding storage batteries and chemical experiments. Seventeen notebooks from January 1917-January 1918 relate primarily to research performed for the U.S. Navy during World War I. Much of this work was done in connection with submarine detection. The remaining thirty-one notebooks begin in May 1918, following Edison's return to West Orange from a three-month stay in Key West, Florida. In addition to military-related experiments, there are notes concerning salts and solutions for use in primary batteries, the processing of lithium ores, the construction of disc record blanks, and chalk telephone (electromotograph) experiments.

One book is devoted  entirely to Edison's European vacation, while several others document his  attempt to introduce talking motion pictures in the United   States and Asia. One  book relates primarily to daughter Madeleine Edison, including her 1914 wedding  to inventor John Eyre Sloane. Two volumes pertain to the fire of December 9,  1914, that destroyed or damaged more than half of the buildings in the West Orange laboratory complex. There are also four  scrapbooks covering the two years preceding the entrance of the United States  into World War I. In addition to articles specifically about Edison and the  Naval Consulting Board, there are more general discussions of submarine  warfare, the progress of the war, and its impact on the American economy. Also  included are numerous interviews with the press, in which Edison voiced his  opinions about a wide variety of topics, including war and preparedness, Henry  Ford's controversial peace plan, the presidential elections of 1912 and 1916,  women's suffrage, temperance and prohibition, cigarette smoking, health and  diet, musical tastes, popular culture, and religion. </p>

<p>This series consists of  clippings sent to Edison by clippings  services, along with others that were collected by his staff or subsequently  added to the collection by archivists. They are primarily from newspapers and  popular magazines, but there are also clippings from Edison  company publications, technical journals, and other printed sources. The  articles pertain to a variety of subjects, including the development and  promotion of Edison's inventions, the  activities of his companies, his role on the Naval Consulting Board, and the  personal affairs of Edison, his wife Mina Miller Edison, and other family  members. In addition to brief newspaper accounts, there are a few longer  articles and profiles based on in-depth interviews with Edison, written either  by journalists or by Edison's assistants. Also  included are advertisements for Edison products and obituaries of Edison family members and former associates.</p>\
