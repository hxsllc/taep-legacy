          <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> project of the scale and complexity of the Thomas
            A. Edison Papers can only be successful through the encouragement, cooperative
            endeavor, and support of many people and organizations. The editors of
            the Edison Papers are fortunate to have the strong backing of its Sponsors:
            Rutgers, The State University; the National Park Service at the Edison
            National Historic Site; the New Jersey Historical Commission; and the Smithsonian
            Institution. Several representatives of the sponsoring institutions have
            given long-standing personal support and direction to the project. These
            include Edward J. Bloustein, President of Rutgers University; T. Alexander
            Pond, Executive Vice-President of Rutgers University; Tilden G. Edelstein,
            Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers University; Roy Weaver,
            Superintendent at the Edison National Historic Site; Edward J. Pershey,
            Supervisory Curator at Edison National Historic Site; Bernard S. Finn,
            Curator of Electricity at the National Museum of American History at the
            Smithsonian Institution; Bernard Bush, Executive Director of the New Jersey
            Historical Commission; and Howard L. Green, Research Director, New Jersey
            Historical Commission. </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>This edition is made possible because of key financial
            support from Rutgers University, the Edison National Historic Site, public
            and private foundations, private corporations, and individuals&mdash;as acknowledged
            in the pages preceding this preface. Moreover, this material is based upon
            work supported by the Program in the History and Philosophy of Science
            at the National Science Foundation under Grant No. SES 82-13220-04, by
            the Program in Research Tools in the Division of Research at the National
            Endowment for the Humanities under Grant No. RE-20341-84, and by the Alfred
            P. Sloan Foundation of New York City. Directors and program officers at
            these foundations have been especially helpful, particularly Ronald Overmann
            at National Science Foundation and Katherine Fuller at National Endowment
            for the Humanities. </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Edison Corporate Associates, a small group
            of executive leaders, have provided major assistance in obtaining financial
            contributions and grants from private foundations, corporations, and individuals.
            William Hittinger, Vice-President for Corporate Research and Development
            (now retired) at RCA, has exercised significant leadership as chairman
            of this group. The Rutgers University Foundation, under the direction of
            Bruce Newman, has worked closely with the members of the Edison Corporate
            Associates in this campaign. Ronald Miller, Director of Corporate and Foundation
            Relations, has exerted special leadership and effort on behalf of the project. </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Edison Papers is fortunate to have outstanding
            presses for both of its editions: The Johns Hopkins University Press for
            the book edition and University Publications of America for the microfilm
            edition. UPA and its staff have responded well to the needs of this unusually
            complex microfilm edition. Especially notable in their effort for Part
            II are John and Michael Moscato, Paul Kesaris, Dale Reynolds, James Glover,
            Risa Jewell, Cynthia Hancock, Laura Harrison, Barbara Stout, Janet Macik,
            and Treeva Wayne. </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>N</FONT>umerous organizations and individuals outside
            of the project have also contributed to Part II of the microfilm edition.
            The National Historical Publications and Records Commission has endorsed
            the Edison Papers project and members of the staff of NHPRC have given
            important counsel over the years. Brooke Hindle, Melvin Kranzberg, and
            Edward C. Carter II as well as members of the Editorial Advisory Board
            have given substantial counsel. Beverly Brown of the Northeast Document
            Conservation Center provided important technical information about the
            filming of the Charles Batchelor scrapbooks. Though the names of Leonard
            S. Reich, Susan Schultz, and Pamela Kwiatkowski&mdash;former members of the staff
            of the Edison Papers&mdash;do not appear on the title page, each has contributed
            to Part II. </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>ithin the institutional settings for the two offices
            of the Edison Papers, many people have contributed either directly or indirectly.
            At the Edison National Historic Site&mdash;where all of the documents contained
            in Part II are located&mdash;Edward J. Pershey and Mary B. Bowling have been
            true partners in the editorial process. Others in the curatorial division
            who have assisted include Eric Olsen, Leah Burt, Marilyn Kyles, and Gladys
            Kyles. Others at the Edison National Historic Site have also assisted in
            a variety of capacities, including Roy Weaver, Marjorie E. Taliaferro,
            Karen Giacobbe, Julie Colatrella, Louis Venuto, and Robert Zimmerman. </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>L</FONT>ikewise, many people within the faculty, library,
            and administration at Rutgers University have provided vital assistance
            and support. Besides President Bloustein and Vice-President Pond, this
            project is indebted to Provosts Kenneth Wheeler, Jean Parrish, John Salapatas
            and Robert F. Pack; Vice-Presidents Nathaniel Pallone and Jose Steinboch;
            David A. Cayer, David Scott, Andrew Rudczynski, Albert Hanna, David A.
            Rumbo, Donna Estler, Muriel Wilson, Helen Gertler, Joseph Harrigan, Ruth
            Scott, Barbara Dawson, John Gillis, Richard P. McCormick, Ruth Simmons,
            Francis Johns, Ron Becker, Leonard Dreifus, and the staff of the Center
            for Computer and Information Services. </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he editors of the Edison Papers conclude their
            acknowledgments with a special note of appreciation for two people who
            are absolutely central to the work of this project. Our Assistant to the
            Director, Helen Endick, and Secretary, Grace Kurkowski, are both highly
            talented and deeply devoted individuals. They perform their jobs in a truly
            outstanding manner and do a number of editorial tasks as well. Their talent,
            devotion, and good humor continue to greatly facilitate the work of this
            project.
